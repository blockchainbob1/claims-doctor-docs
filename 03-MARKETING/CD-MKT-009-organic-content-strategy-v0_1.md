# Organic Content Strategy — HubSpot Topic Clusters & Pillar Pages

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This document defines the organic content strategy for claimsdoctor.com.au, using HubSpot's topic cluster model to build topical authority across the WorkCover and CTP medical services landscape. The strategy establishes six interlinked topic clusters covering WorkCover doctor access, Certificates of Capacity, telehealth legitimacy, mental health claims, return-to-work planning, and B2B referral partnerships — totalling 6 pillar pages and 60 subtopic blog posts (66 content assets).

---

## 02 Scope

This document applies to all organic website content published on claimsdoctor.com.au via HubSpot. It covers content architecture, topic cluster definitions, keyword targeting, publication standards, and implementation phasing. It does not cover paid search (see CD-MKT-005), social media content (see CD-MKT-006), or email/SMS nurture content (see CD-MKT-008).

---

## 03 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Pillar page | A comprehensive, long-form website page (2,500–4,000 words) broadly covering a core topic, serving as the central hub linking to all related subtopic content |
| Subtopic post | A focused blog post (1,000–1,800 words) addressing a specific question within a broader topic, linking back to its parent pillar page |
| Topic cluster | The combined structure of one pillar page and its 8–12 associated subtopic posts, connected by bidirectional internal links |
| Topical authority | Google's assessment of a site's depth and breadth of coverage on a given subject, influenced by the quality and interlinking of related content |
| Certificate of Capacity | The SIRA-mandated WorkCover injury assessment document |
| Certificate of Fitness | The SIRA-mandated CTP injury assessment document |
| AHPRA | Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency |
| SIRA | State Insurance Regulatory Authority (NSW) |

---

## 04 Strategic Context

Claims Doctor occupies a unique position in the Australian workers compensation landscape as the only provider offering same-day telehealth medical consultations with doctors experienced in WorkCover claims. The organic content strategy addresses three market dynamics that create opportunity.

**Demand-side pressure.** Over 146,700 serious workers compensation claims are made annually, system costs total $28.6 billion, and the GP shortage exceeds 2,400 full-time equivalents. 49% of GPs report wanting to refuse compensable patients. Injured workers face significant barriers to accessing the medical care their claims require.

**Competitive gap.** No major competitor offers same-day telehealth for WorkCover. At least one competitor (Rose Medical) actively argues WorkCover certificates cannot be issued via telehealth — a position contradicted by SIRA guidelines that explicitly allow telehealth under specified conditions.

**Growth segment.** Mental health claims in NSW have grown 161% and now represent 38% of workers compensation costs. The average time off work for a psychological injury claim is 37 weeks compared to 8 weeks for other claims. Telehealth consultations are particularly well-suited to this segment.

The organic content strategy is designed to reduce cost-per-acquisition by building organic visibility alongside paid search (CD-MKT-005), capture high-intent search traffic for WorkCover medical information, and generate inbound leads from both injured workers (B2C) and referral partners (B2B).

---

## 05 Topic Cluster Model

The topic cluster model organises website content around core topics rather than isolated keywords, signalling to search engines that the site has deep, authoritative coverage of a subject area. The model consists of three interconnected components.

**Pillar pages** are comprehensive, long-form pages (2,500–4,000 words) that broadly cover a core topic. Each serves as the central hub and links out to all related subtopic content. Pillar pages are published as website pages (not blog posts) for clean URL structure.

**Subtopic posts** are focused blog posts (1,000–1,800 words) that address specific questions within the broader topic. Each subtopic post links back to its parent pillar page with a hyperlink using the pillar's target keyword as anchor text.

**Internal linking structure** creates bidirectional hyperlinking between pillar pages and subtopic posts, forming a web of topical authority. Related subtopics also cross-link to each other where relevant, and cross-cluster links are used where topics naturally overlap. HubSpot's SEO Topics tool validates and monitors this linking.

The model benefits Claims Doctor through compound organic growth (subtopic rankings pass authority to pillar pages, which lift all connected subtopics), Google Ads synergy (pillar pages with strong organic rankings improve Quality Scores for aligned campaigns, reducing cost-per-click), and improved user experience (visitors landing on any content piece can navigate to related information, increasing time-on-site and conversion probability).

## 13 HubSpot Setup Instructions

### 13.1 Navigate to SEO Topics

Go to Marketing → Website → SEO → Topics in the HubSpot portal. This is the central dashboard for managing all topic clusters.

### 13.2 Create each pillar topic

Click "Add a topic" and enter the core pillar keyword (e.g., "certificate of capacity"). HubSpot will display search volume and competitive data. Repeat for all six pillar topics.

### 13.3 Add subtopic keywords

Within each topic, click "Add subtopic keyword" to add the 8–10 subtopic keywords for that cluster. Enter the primary keyword for each planned blog post (e.g., "certificate of capacity telehealth").

### 13.4 Create pillar pages as website pages

Pillar pages should be created as website pages (not blog posts) in HubSpot. This gives them a clean URL structure (e.g., claimsdoctor.com.au/workcover-doctor-guide). Each pillar page should be 2,500–4,000 words with a table of contents.

### 13.5 Create subtopic content as blog posts

Publish each subtopic article as a blog post in HubSpot. Use the primary subtopic keyword in the URL slug, H1 title, and meta title.

### 13.6 Link subtopics back to pillar pages

In every subtopic blog post, include a contextual hyperlink back to the parent pillar page. Use the pillar's target keyword (or a close variation) as anchor text. Place this link in the introduction and/or a summary section.

### 13.7 Cross-link related subtopics

Where subtopics within the same cluster are related, add cross-links between them. Also link across clusters where relevant (e.g., a Cluster 4 mental health post can link to a Cluster 3 telehealth post).

### 13.8 Validate internal linking

HubSpot's Topics tool will automatically validate the internal linking structure. Check for green ticks — if a subtopic shows a warning, verify the hyperlink from the subtopic post back to the pillar page exists and is correctly configured. HubSpot typically refreshes link validation within 24 hours after re-publishing.

### 13.9 Monitor performance

Use the Topics dashboard to track topic search authority, pillar page ranking position, subtopic post performance, and overall cluster traffic. Review weekly during Phase 1–3 rollout, then monthly thereafter.

---

## 14 Content Format Guidelines

### 14.1 Pillar pages

Pillar pages should be 2,500–4,000 words, comprehensive and authoritative. Each pillar page must include a clickable table of contents at the top, use H2 and H3 subheadings for clear structure and featured snippet eligibility, include an FAQ section at the bottom (minimum 5 FAQs) with FAQ schema markup, add relevant internal links to all associated subtopic posts, and include a prominent CTA to book a consultation (above the fold and at the end). Pillar pages are published as website pages for clean URL structure.

### 14.2 Subtopic blog posts

Subtopic posts should be 1,000–1,800 words, focused on one specific question or topic. The H1 title should include the primary subtopic keyword. Each post must include a contextual hyperlink back to the parent pillar page (within the first 200 words and in a summary/CTA), cross-link to 1–2 related subtopic posts within the same cluster, and include a CTA to book a consultation or download a resource. Structured data should be used where applicable (FAQ, How-To, Article schema).

### 14.3 SEO requirements — all content

Every content piece must have a meta title under 60 characters including the primary keyword, a meta description under 160 characters including the primary keyword and a call-to-action, at least 2 internal links (1 to pillar page, 1 to related subtopic), alt text on all images using descriptive keyword-aware language, and a URL slug that is short, keyword-rich, lowercase with hyphens only (no dates or numbers).

### 14.4 Compliance and style

All content must use Australian English spelling throughout ("organisation", "specialised", "defence", "practise" as verb). Content must comply with AHPRA advertising guidelines: no guarantees of treatment outcomes, no patient testimonials about clinical outcomes, no claims of superiority over other practitioners. Do not name competitors in published content — present authoritative information citing SIRA guidelines and regulatory sources, and let readers draw their own conclusions.

Tone should be empathetic, professional, and informative — avoid legalistic jargon and explain complex concepts in plain English. All medical content must include date of publication and "last reviewed" date. Factual claims must cite authoritative sources (SIRA, SafeWork Australia, ABS, state regulators).

### 14.5 AHPRA compliance review workflow

Every content piece must be reviewed for AHPRA advertising guideline compliance before publication. During pre-revenue and sole-practitioner phase, the owner (Robert Laidlaw) is responsible for AHPRA review. A compliance checklist covering prohibited claims, testimonial restrictions, and accuracy of regulatory citations should be completed for each piece before it goes live. This requirement should be revisited when content production is delegated to contractors or staff.

## 15 Keyword Priority Matrix

The following table maps the top target keywords across all six clusters. Estimated monthly search volumes are based on Australian market data and reflect approximate ranges for the workers compensation vertical. Difficulty ratings are relative within this niche. Actual volumes should be validated using Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush with an Australian (.com.au) target.

| Keyword | Est. Monthly Volume (AU) | Difficulty | Cluster | Priority | Ads Alignment |
|---------|------------------------:|-----------|---------|----------|---------------|
| certificate of capacity | 2,400 | Medium | 2 | High | B2C Certificate |

### Keywords removed from original strategy

The original strategy included "workcover doctor Sydney" (590/mo) and "workcover doctor Melbourne" (520/mo). The Sydney keyword has been retained implicitly via the NSW-focused subtopic (6.8). The Melbourne keyword has been removed — Claims Doctor operates in NSW only. Ranking for Melbourne traffic would generate clicks that cannot convert. If interstate expansion is planned, Melbourne and other state-specific keywords should be reintroduced under a separate geographic expansion addendum.

## 16 Cross-Cluster Linking Map

The following cross-cluster links should be implemented where content naturally overlaps. These strengthen topical authority across the full content ecosystem.

| From | To | Connection |
|------|-----|-----------|
| Cluster 4, subtopic 9.5 (CoC for mental health) | Cluster 2 pillar (Certificate of Capacity) | Certificate specifics for psychological injuries |
| Cluster 4, subtopic 9.6 (Telehealth for mental health) | Cluster 3 pillar (Telehealth for WorkCover) | Telehealth suitability for psychological consultations |
| Cluster 4, subtopic 9.8 (RTW for mental health) | Cluster 5 pillar (Return to Work) | RTW challenges specific to psychological injuries |
| Cluster 5, subtopic 10.7 (RTW for psychological injuries) | Cluster 4 pillar (Mental Health) | Full mental health claims context |
| Cluster 1, subtopic 6.9 (Frequency of visits) | Cluster 2 pillar (Certificate of Capacity) | Renewal timelines driving visit frequency |
| Cluster 2, subtopic 7.4 (CoC via telehealth) | Cluster 3 pillar (Telehealth for WorkCover) | Telehealth legitimacy for certificates |
| Cluster 3, subtopic 8.7 (Mental health and telehealth) | Cluster 4 pillar (Mental Health) | Mental health claims context |
| Cluster 6, subtopic 11.5 (Same-day access business case) | Cluster 3 pillar (Telehealth for WorkCover) | Telehealth operational model |

## 17 Risk Register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-----------|--------|-----------|
| **SIRA telehealth regulatory risk.** SIRA requires telehealth be delivered "in combination with in-person services." If strictly enforced, Claims Doctor's telehealth-first model and Cluster 3 content could become a liability. | Medium | High | Monitor SIRA guidance updates. Ensure all telehealth content accurately reflects current regulatory requirements. Prepare contingency content positioning in-person availability if regulatory position tightens. Do not overstate telehealth eligibility beyond what SIRA guidelines explicitly permit. |
| **Capacity to produce content.** The roadmap requires 2–3 subtopic articles per week from Month 3. As sole practitioner and founder, this competes directly with clinical hours and business operations. | High | Medium | Consider outsourcing content writing to a medical content agency or freelancer with WorkCover knowledge. All outsourced content still requires AHPRA compliance review. Alternatively, extend the timeline — full cluster depth by Month 12 instead of Month 9. |
| **AHPRA compliance breach.** Content that inadvertently makes prohibited claims (outcome guarantees, superiority claims, clinical testimonials) could trigger regulatory action. | Low | High | AHPRA compliance checklist for every content piece before publication (section 14.5). No patient testimonials about clinical outcomes. No comparative claims against named competitors. Cite regulatory sources for all factual claims. |
| **Keyword cannibalisation.** Multiple subtopics targeting similar keywords within the same cluster could compete with each other in search results. | Medium | Low | Ensure each subtopic targets a distinct primary keyword. Use HubSpot's Topics tool to monitor for cannibalisation. Consolidate or differentiate content where overlap is detected. |
| **Search volume estimates inaccurate.** Keyword volumes are approximate and based on niche estimates. Actual demand may differ significantly. | Medium | Low | Validate all keyword volumes using Google Keyword Planner, Ahrefs, or SEMrush with AU targeting before committing to content production. Adjust cluster priority if validated volumes differ materially from estimates. |
