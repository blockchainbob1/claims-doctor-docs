## 01 Purpose

This document establishes the clinical governance framework for Claims Doctor. It defines the structures, accountabilities, policies, and processes that ensure the safety and quality of all clinical services delivered through the Claims Doctor telehealth platform. All other clinical governance, operational, and compliance documents derive from this framework.

---

## 02 Scope

**Applies to:** All Claims Doctor personnel including the Medical Director, contracted doctors, administrative staff, and any third parties involved in clinical service delivery.

**Covers:** Clinical leadership and accountability, scope of practice, credentialing requirements, quality and audit processes, incident management, patient safety, technology governance, and regulatory compliance for all telehealth consultations delivered under the Claims Doctor ABN.

**Does not cover:** Financial operations (see CD-FIN series), marketing and growth (see CD-MKT series), or employment matters unrelated to clinical service delivery (see CD-HR series).

## 04 Service Model

Claims Doctor delivers telehealth-only medical consultations for the purpose of WorkCover and CTP injury claim management in New South Wales.

### 04.1 Consultation Modality

The primary consultation modality is synchronous video via Google Meet. Phone consultation is permitted only where video is unavailable due to patient-side technical limitations. The treating doctor must document the reason video was not used.

### 04.2 Technology Platform

| Function | Platform |
|----------|----------|
| Video consultation | Google Meet |
| Patient management system | Halaxy |
| Clinical documentation / AI note-taking | Heidi Health |
| Prescriptions | Halaxy (electronic prescribing) |

Technology platform changes require Medical Director approval and must be assessed for clinical safety, data security, and regulatory compliance before adoption. Platform governance is further detailed in CD-OPS-011.

### 04.3 Scope of Clinical Services

**In scope:**

- Certificates of Capacity (WorkCover NSW)
- Certificates of Fitness (CTP NSW)
- Management of work injury insurance claims including review, assessment, and ongoing certification
- Prescription of medications relevant to injury management (via Halaxy)
- Referrals to specialists, allied health, and diagnostic services as clinically indicated

**Out of scope (must be referred to an appropriate provider):**

- Acute or emergency presentations
- Mental health care plans (Better Access)
- Chronic disease management plans (GPMP/TCA)
- Any presentation outside the WorkCover/CTP injury claim context

Any doctor who identifies an out-of-scope clinical need during a consultation must advise the patient to attend their regular GP or an appropriate service, and document this advice in the clinical record.

---

## 05 Clinical Leadership & Accountability

### 05.1 Medical Director

**Dr Robert Laidlaw** is the Medical Director and Clinical Lead. The Medical Director holds ultimate authority and accountability for:

- All clinical decisions, standards, and protocols within Claims Doctor
- Final determination of clinical disputes
- Approval of clinical policies and procedures
- Credentialing and privileging of contracted doctors
- Clinical audit program and quality improvement
- Incident review and management
- Regulatory compliance relating to clinical services

The Medical Director must hold current AHPRA registration, professional indemnity insurance meeting the minimum requirements set out in this framework, and membership of a recognised medical defence organisation.

### 05.2 Clinical Advisory Committee

A Clinical Advisory Committee (CAC) will be established within 90 days of Claims Doctor engaging its third contracted doctor. Until the CAC is established, all clinical governance functions are discharged solely by the Medical Director.

**CAC composition (once established):**

- Medical Director (Chair)
- Minimum two contracted doctors (rotating annually)

**CAC responsibilities:**

- Review and recommend updates to clinical protocols (CD-GOV-003)
- Review aggregate clinical audit findings
- Advise on scope of practice changes
- Review de-identified incident reports and recommend system improvements
- Meet quarterly (minimum), with minutes recorded and retained

## 06 Doctor Credentialing & Requirements

### 06.1 Minimum Requirements

All doctors engaged by Claims Doctor must meet the following at the time of engagement and continuously throughout their contract:

| Requirement | Minimum Standard |
|-------------|-----------------|
| AHPRA registration | General or specialist registration, current and unconditional |
| Clinical experience | Minimum PGY3 with at least 2 years of hospital experience |
| Professional indemnity insurance | Minimum $20 million |
| Medical defence organisation | Current membership |
| Working with Children Check | Current (if applicable to jurisdiction) |
| National Police Check | Within 12 months of engagement |
| Telehealth competency | Demonstrated or trained prior to first consultation |

### 06.2 Credentialing Process

Credentialing is conducted by the Medical Director prior to a doctor's first consultation. Full credentialing procedures are documented in CD-GOV-002.

The credentialing process includes:

- Verification of AHPRA registration (direct AHPRA register check)
- Verification of PII certificate of currency
- Review of CV and clinical experience
- Verification of identity documents
- Criminal history check
- Reference check (minimum one clinical referee)
- Completion of Claims Doctor platform orientation and training
- Observed/supervised initial consultation(s) at Medical Director discretion

### 06.3 Re-credentialing

All contracted doctors must be re-credentialed annually. Re-credentialing includes:

- Confirmation of current AHPRA registration
- Current PII certificate of currency
- Review of clinical audit results and any incidents
- Review of patient feedback and complaints
- CPD compliance (as per AHPRA requirements — no Claims Doctor-specific CPD requirements at this time; to be reviewed within 90 days of first contracted doctor engagement)

Failure to provide current documentation by the re-credentialing due date results in immediate suspension of consulting privileges until documentation is received.

## 07 Clinical Quality & Audit

### 07.1 Clinical Audit Program

The Medical Director is responsible for the clinical audit program. The program operates as follows:

| Element | Standard |
|---------|----------|
| Audit frequency | Monthly chart reviews |
| Audit rate | 5% of all consultations (applies once more than one doctor is practising) |
| Auditor | Medical Director (or delegate approved by Medical Director) |
| Audit criteria | Completeness of clinical documentation, appropriateness of certification, adherence to clinical protocols (CD-GOV-003), prescription appropriateness, referral appropriateness |

While Claims Doctor operates with a single doctor (the Medical Director), self-audit will be conducted monthly against the same criteria for quality assurance purposes.

### 07.2 Key Performance Indicators

| KPI | Target | Measurement |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| Certificate turnaround time (from consultation to issue) | < 4 hours | Halaxy timestamps |
| Patient complaint rate | < 10% | Complaints received / total consultations |
| Clinical audit compliance rate | 100% of scheduled audits completed | Monthly audit log |
| Credentialing currency | 100% of active doctors fully credentialed | Credentialing register |
| Incident reporting compliance | 100% of incidents reported within 24 hours | Incident database |

KPIs are reviewed monthly by the Medical Director and quarterly by the CAC (once established). KPI dashboard specification is documented in CD-RPT-001.

### 07.3 Quality Improvement

Findings from clinical audits, incident reports, patient complaints, and KPI reviews must result in documented quality improvement actions where deficiencies are identified. The Medical Director maintains a quality improvement register that tracks:

- Issue identified
- Date identified
- Action required
- Person responsible
- Due date
- Date completed
- Outcome

---

## 08 Incident Management

### 08.1 Reporting

All clinical incidents, near-misses, and adverse events must be reported by the involved doctor within 24 hours of the event or discovery. Reports are recorded in the Claims Doctor incident database.

An incident includes any event that resulted in, or had the potential to result in, harm to a patient, including but not limited to:

- Incorrect certification
- Prescription error
- Missed diagnosis or delayed referral
- Patient complaint alleging clinical harm
- Breach of patient privacy or confidentiality
- Technology failure that impacted clinical care

### 08.2 Review

The Medical Director reviews all incident reports. Review frequency is monthly as a minimum, with immediate review for incidents assessed as serious (actual patient harm, mandatory notification events, or complaints to external bodies).

### 08.3 Escalation

The following incidents require immediate escalation and action:

- Any event that is a mandatory notification under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law
- Any event requiring notification to SIRA
- Any event involving actual serious patient harm
- Any complaint or investigation by AHPRA, the Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC), or another regulatory body

Detailed incident reporting and management procedures are documented in CD-GOV-005.

## 09 Patient Safety

### 09.1 Informed Consent

All patients must provide informed consent prior to a telehealth consultation. Consent must cover:

- The nature and limitations of telehealth consultation
- The scope of services provided by Claims Doctor
- Privacy and data handling practices
- The patient's right to withdraw consent at any time
- The patient's right to seek care from another provider

Consent procedures and templates are documented in CD-LEG-008 and CD-LEG-011.

### 09.2 Medical Records

All clinical consultations must be documented in Halaxy. Clinical records must comply with the requirements of the Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW), the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), and SIRA record-keeping requirements.

Records must include, at minimum:

- Patient identification and contact details
- Date and time of consultation
- Consultation modality (video or phone, with reason if phone)
- Presenting complaint and relevant history
- Clinical findings
- Diagnosis or assessment
- Management plan including certification details
- Prescriptions issued
- Referrals made
- Follow-up plan

Medical records management policy is detailed in CD-GOV-004.

### 09.3 Medication Management

Prescriptions are issued through Halaxy's electronic prescribing function. Prescribing is limited to medications relevant to the injury being managed under the WorkCover or CTP claim. Medication management policy is detailed in CD-GOV-006.

### 09.4 Open Disclosure

Claims Doctor adopts the Australian Open Disclosure Framework as its standard for communicating with patients when things go wrong. Open disclosure is a non-negotiable obligation — not a discretionary courtesy.

**Principles:**

- Patients have a right to be informed when an incident during their care has resulted in, or could result in, harm
- Communication must be honest, timely, and expressed in plain language
- Open disclosure is not an admission of liability — it is a duty of care
- The process must be documented but must never be used punitively against the clinician involved

**When open disclosure is required:**

- Any clinical incident where a patient has experienced harm or where harm is reasonably foreseeable
- Incorrect certification that has been issued to an insurer or employer
- Prescription errors
- Failure to refer when referral was clinically indicated
- Breach of patient privacy or confidentiality

**Process:**

1. **Immediate acknowledgement (within 24 hours of discovery):** The treating doctor must notify the Medical Director. The Medical Director determines whether open disclosure is required and who will lead the disclosure conversation.
2. **Initial disclosure conversation:** Conducted by the Medical Director, or by the treating doctor with Medical Director approval and guidance. Must occur as soon as practicable and no later than 48 hours after the incident is confirmed. The conversation must include:
   - An acknowledgement that an incident occurred
   - The known facts at the time of disclosure
   - An apology or expression of regret (consistent with NSW civil liability protections for apologies under the Civil Liability Act 2002, s 69)
   - An explanation of what is being done to investigate and prevent recurrence
   - An outline of the support available to the patient, including the right to make a complaint
3. **Follow-up communication:** The patient must be updated on investigation findings and any corrective actions taken. Follow-up must occur within 14 days of the initial disclosure, or sooner if the investigation is completed earlier.
4. **Documentation:** All open disclosure conversations must be documented in the patient's clinical record in Halaxy, including the date, time, participants, content discussed, and any commitments made. A copy of the disclosure record must also be entered in the incident database.
5. **Clinician support:** The treating doctor involved in the incident must be offered a debrief with the Medical Director. Open disclosure is a system response, not blame allocation. No adverse action may be taken against a clinician solely for participating in open disclosure.

**Limitations of telehealth context:**

Open disclosure conversations will occur via video call (Google Meet) as the primary modality. Phone is acceptable if video is not feasible. Written disclosure (email or letter) may supplement but must not replace a verbal conversation unless the patient expressly declines a verbal discussion.

---

## 11 Framework Review

This framework must be reviewed:

- At minimum every 6 months
- Following any serious clinical incident
- Following any material change to legislation, regulation, or SIRA requirements
- Following any significant change to the Claims Doctor service model
- When the CAC recommends a review

Any material change to this framework constitutes a major version bump and triggers a mandatory review of all dependent documents (per CD-STR-000 dependency rules).
