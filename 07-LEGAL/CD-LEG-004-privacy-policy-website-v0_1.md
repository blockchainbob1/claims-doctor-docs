We collect, hold, and use your information for the following purposes:

## 07 Disclosure of Information

We may disclose your personal and health information to the following recipients:

**Insurers and employers** — as required under NSW workers' compensation and CTP legislation. This includes disclosure of Certificates of Capacity and Certificates of Fitness, and associated medical information as mandated by SIRA.

These providers act as data processors and are contractually required to protect your information and use it only for the purposes we specify.

**Government and regulatory bodies** — AHPRA, SIRA, the NSW Ministry of Health, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner, law enforcement, and other authorities where disclosure is required or authorised by law.

## 08 Cross-Border Data Transfers

All personal and health information collected by Claims Doctor is stored and processed within Australia. Our core technology providers — including our patient management system (Halaxy), telehealth platform (Google Meet), and payment processor (Stripe Payments Australia) — operate Australian-hosted infrastructure for the data we collect.

We do not knowingly transfer your personal or health information to any overseas recipient. If this changes in the future, we will update this policy to identify the relevant countries and the steps we take to protect your information in accordance with APP 8.

---

## 09 Data Security

We take reasonable steps to protect your personal and health information from misuse, interference, loss, and from unauthorised access, modification, or disclosure, in accordance with APP 11 and HPP 5.

Our security measures include encryption of data in transit and at rest, access controls limiting information access to authorised personnel, secure authentication for our telehealth platform, regular review of our security practices, and contractual obligations on third-party service providers to maintain appropriate security standards.

No data transmission over the internet or electronic storage method is completely secure. While we strive to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.

---

**Adult patients** — health records are retained for a minimum of 7 years from the date of last contact.

## 12 Telehealth-Specific Matters

### 12.1 Consultation Recording

Telehealth consultations may be recorded (audio and/or video) where deemed clinically necessary by the treating doctor. Recordings may be used for clinical documentation, quality assurance, and continuity of care.

We may also use AI-assisted clinical note-taking tools (such as Heidi Health) during consultations to generate clinical notes and documentation. These tools process audio from the consultation in real time to assist the treating doctor with accurate record-keeping.

You will be informed at the commencement of any consultation where recording or AI note-taking is in use, and your consent will be obtained before proceeding. If you do not consent to recording or AI-assisted note-taking, the consultation will proceed without these tools and the treating doctor will take manual notes.

Recordings and AI-generated notes are stored securely as part of your clinical record and retained in accordance with the retention periods set out in Section 10.

### 12.2 Telehealth Platform and Clinical Systems

Our telehealth consultations are conducted via Google Meet. Google Meet may collect technical data necessary to facilitate the video consultation, including connection quality data and session logs. Google's privacy policy is available at policies.google.com/privacy.

Patient records, clinical notes, and booking information are managed through Halaxy, our patient management system. Halaxy stores health information on Australian-hosted servers. Halaxy's privacy policy is available at www.halaxy.com/privacy.

Payments are processed by Stripe Payments Australia. Stripe collects payment card details directly and processes transactions on our behalf. We do not store your full card details on our systems. Stripe's privacy policy is available at stripe.com/au/privacy.

### 12.3 SMS and Email Communications

We may send you SMS or email communications for the purposes of appointment confirmations, reminders, and post-consultation follow-up. By providing your contact details and booking a consultation, you consent to receiving these operational communications. You may opt out of non-essential communications at any time by contacting us.

---

## 13 Mandatory Reporting Obligations

In certain circumstances, we are required by law to disclose your health information without your consent. These circumstances include:

**Mandatory reporting to AHPRA** — where a registered health practitioner forms a reasonable belief that another practitioner has placed the public at risk.

**Child protection reporting** — where there is a reasonable suspicion that a child is at risk of significant harm, as required under the Children and Young Persons (Care and Protection) Act 1998 (NSW).

**Notifiable conditions** — where a treating doctor identifies a condition that is notifiable under the Public Health Act 2010 (NSW).

**Serious threats to life or health** — where disclosure is necessary to prevent or lessen a serious threat to the life, health, or safety of any individual, or to public health or safety.

**Court orders and law enforcement** — where disclosure is required by a court order, subpoena, or other legal requirement.

## 14 Your Rights

### 14.1 Access to Your Information

You have the right to request access to the personal and health information we hold about you, in accordance with APP 12 and HPP 6. We will respond to access requests within 30 days. In most cases, we will provide access free of charge, but we may charge a reasonable fee for retrieving and preparing information if the request is complex.

We may refuse access in limited circumstances permitted by law, such as where access would pose a serious threat to health or safety, or where the information relates to existing or anticipated legal proceedings.

### 14.2 Correction of Your Information

If you believe the personal or health information we hold about you is inaccurate, incomplete, out of date, or misleading, you may request that we correct it, in accordance with APP 13 and HPP 7. We will respond to correction requests within 30 days.

### 14.3 Anonymity and Pseudonymity

Under APP 2, you have the right to deal with us anonymously or using a pseudonym where practicable. However, due to the nature of our medical services — including the legal requirements for patient identification on Certificates of Capacity and Certificates of Fitness — it is generally not practicable for us to provide our core services without verifying your identity.

### 14.4 Withdrawal of Consent

Where we rely on your consent as the basis for collecting or using your information, you may withdraw that consent at any time by contacting us. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the lawfulness of any processing carried out prior to withdrawal, and does not affect processing that is authorised or required by law independently of consent.

### 14.5 Requesting Deletion

You may request that we delete your personal information. We will comply where we are not required by law to retain it. Note that we are legally required to retain health records for the periods specified in Section 10 and cannot delete these records before the retention period expires.
