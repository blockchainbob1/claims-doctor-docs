# Telehealth Consent Policy

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This policy establishes the requirements for obtaining, recording, and managing patient consent for telehealth consultations provided by Claims Doctor. It ensures compliance with AHPRA's Guidelines: Telehealth Consultations With Patients (effective 1 September 2023, updated 7 October 2025), the Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002 (NSW), the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth), and the SIRA Guidelines for the Provision of Relevant Services (Health and Related Services).

This policy also governs patient consent for disclosure of health information to nominated third parties — a critical risk control for Claims Doctor given the multi-stakeholder nature of WorkCover and CTP claims and the potential for disputes about information sharing.

---

## 02 Scope

**Applies to:**

- All medical practitioners engaged by Claims Doctor to provide telehealth consultations.
- All Claims Doctor administrative and operational staff involved in patient intake, triage, booking, or records management.
- All telehealth consultations conducted under the Claims Doctor service model, whether for WorkCover (Certificate of Capacity) or CTP (Certificate of Fitness) purposes.

**Does not apply to:**

- Face-to-face consultations (if introduced in future, a separate consent protocol will apply).
- Internal communications between Claims Doctor staff that do not involve disclosure of patient health information to external parties.

---

## 04 Regulatory Framework

### 4.1 AHPRA Telehealth Guidelines (Updated October 2025)

AHPRA requires that practitioners providing telehealth services:

- Provide the patient with an explanation of what to expect from a telehealth consultation.
- Obtain informed consent in relation to fees, proposed treatment, sharing of information with others in the care team, and whether the consultation is being recorded.
- Ensure that telehealth does not replace in-person care where physical examination is clinically required.
- Confirm patient identity prior to the consultation.
- Advise the patient if the standard of care cannot meet the equivalent of an in-person consultation.
- Obtain explicit consent before using any AI-assisted tools (e.g., AI scribes) that capture or store patient information.

### 4.2 HRIP Act and Health Privacy Principles (NSW)

Under the HRIP Act:

- Health information may only be collected for a lawful purpose directly related to the organisation's function and reasonably necessary for that purpose (HPP 1–4).
- Disclosure to a third party for a secondary purpose requires the patient's consent, unless an exemption applies (HPP 11).
- The patient must be informed at or around the time of collection of the likely third parties to whom their information may be disclosed (HPP 5).
- Consent must be obtained before records are transferred to any other provider.

### 4.3 SIRA Requirements

The SIRA Certificate of Capacity/Certificate of Fitness includes a consent section whereby the patient authorises:

> "My treating medical practitioner, my employer (optional for CTP claims), the insurer, other medical practitioners or health related practitioners (whether consulting, treating or examining), workplace rehabilitation providers and SIRA exchanging information for the purpose of managing my injury."

Under section 47(5) of the Workplace Injury Management and Workers Compensation Act 1998, the worker must authorise their NTD to provide relevant information to the insurer or employer for injury management purposes. Any further authority beyond this must be given voluntarily.

**Telehealth delivery requirements.** Part 2 of the SIRA Guidelines for the Provision of Relevant Services (Health and Related Services) requires that medical practitioners must provide telehealth services:

- In combination with in-person services, unless the services are pre-approved by the insurer managing the injured person's claim for delivery exclusively by telehealth.
- By videoconference unless videoconference is unavailable. Email, SMS, or an app may only be used in conjunction with the delivery of telehealth via videoconference.
- Only if the injured worker requests or consents to participate in a telehealth service.

**Claims Doctor's compliance position.** Claims Doctor provides discrete, episodic assessment and certification services — not ongoing primary care. In the typical Claims Doctor patient pathway, the patient's Nominated Treating Doctor (NTD) provides in-person care, and Claims Doctor provides a supplementary telehealth assessment for the purpose of issuing a Certificate of Capacity or Certificate of Fitness. The "in combination with in-person services" requirement is therefore satisfied by the patient's existing in-person care relationship with their NTD. Where a patient does not have an NTD or is not receiving in-person care from any provider, Claims Doctor will either (a) seek insurer pre-approval for exclusive telehealth delivery, or (b) refer the patient to an appropriate provider for in-person assessment. This position is documented in the patient's clinical record and is consistent with the SIRA requirement.

### 4.4 Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)

The Australian Privacy Principles (APPs) require that health information be collected with consent, used only for the purpose of collection, and disclosed to third parties only with consent or where authorised by law.

### 4.5 Telecommunications and Surveillance Legislation

Recording of telehealth consultations requires the express consent of all participants under the Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth). The Surveillance Devices Act 2007 (NSW) separately prohibits the recording of private conversations without the consent of all parties to the conversation (s7). Both Acts apply to telehealth consultations conducted by Claims Doctor.

### 4.6 NSW Workers Compensation Reform — Standing Note

The Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment Bill 2025 (passed November 2025) and the Workers Compensation Legislation Amendment (Reform and Modernisation) Bill 2025 (passed February 2026) introduce significant changes to the NSW Workers Compensation scheme. As at the date of this document, the commencement dates for many provisions have not yet been proclaimed, and SIRA's regulations and guidelines are being updated. This policy will be reviewed when SIRA publishes updated Guidelines for the Provision of Relevant Services or when the relevant commencement dates are proclaimed, whichever is earlier.

## 05 Consent Requirements

### 5.1 Telehealth Consultation Consent

Before the first telehealth consultation, every patient must be informed of and consent to the following:

1. **Nature of the service.** The consultation will be conducted via real-time video (preferred) or telephone. Telephone is permitted only where the patient is unable to connect via video due to a documented technical limitation on the patient's side. The consultation is not a substitute for emergency care. If the practitioner determines that the clinical situation requires in-person examination, the patient will be advised to attend a face-to-face consultation with an appropriate provider.

2. **Scope of service.** Claims Doctor provides assessment and certification for WorkCover and CTP claims. The consultation is focused on functional capacity assessment and issuing the relevant SIRA certificate. Claims Doctor does not provide ongoing primary care or manage conditions outside the scope of the claim. Where clinically appropriate, the practitioner may prescribe medications relevant to the injury being managed under the claim — prescribing is limited to this scope and is governed by CD-GOV-001 s09.3 and CD-GOV-006 (Medication Management Policy).

3. **Limitations of telehealth.** The patient must be informed that telehealth may not provide the same diagnostic capability as a face-to-face consultation. Physical examination is not possible. The practitioner may be unable to detect certain clinical signs. If the practitioner considers the consultation inadequate for safe clinical decision-making, the certificate may not be issued and the patient will be referred for in-person assessment.

4. **Identity verification.** The patient must present valid government-issued photo identification (driver's licence, passport, or Medicare card in combination with a secondary form of ID) at the commencement of the consultation. Identity will be verified against the claim details.

5. **Technology requirements.** The patient must have access to a device with a camera, microphone, and stable internet connection for video consultations. The patient is responsible for ensuring they are in a private, quiet location suitable for a clinical consultation.

6. **Privacy and security.** The consultation will be conducted on a platform that complies with the Privacy Act 1988, the HRIP Act, and AHPRA's telehealth guidelines. The patient must be informed of the platform being used and that the consultation is not recorded unless explicit consent is obtained.

7. **Recording consent (if applicable).** If any recording of the consultation is to occur — for quality assurance, training, clinical record-keeping, or any other purpose — the patient must provide separate, explicit consent. Recording is not a condition of service.

8. **AI tools consent (if applicable).** If Claims Doctor uses any AI-assisted tools during the consultation (e.g., AI transcription, clinical decision support), the patient must be informed of this and must consent to the tool's use, including how the tool captures and stores information.

9. **Fees.** The patient must be informed of any applicable fees, including whether the consultation is fully funded under the WorkCover/CTP scheme or whether any out-of-pocket costs may apply. Current fee schedules are maintained in CD-FIN-002.

10. **Right to withdraw.** The patient may withdraw consent and terminate the consultation at any time without penalty. Withdrawal of consent does not affect the patient's entitlement to seek assessment or certification from another provider.

### 5.2 Third-Party Disclosure Consent

Claims Doctor operates within a multi-stakeholder claims ecosystem. Information must flow between the patient, the treating practitioner, and various external parties to facilitate injury management and return to work. However, each disclosure channel must be explicitly authorised by the patient.

The Supplementary Consent Form (Appendix A) captures consent for the following four disclosure categories:

#### Category 1 — Regular General Practitioner (GP)

- **Purpose:** To ensure continuity of care between Claims Doctor and the patient's usual GP. The GP may receive a copy of the consultation summary, the certificate issued, and relevant clinical notes.
- **Consent mechanism:** Tick box to authorise + mandatory write-in field for GP name, practice name, and contact details.
- **Rationale:** AHPRA's telehealth guidance requires that practitioners, with the patient's consent, inform other relevant health practitioners of the treatment provided. This is particularly important where Claims Doctor is not the NTD and the patient's regular GP holds the primary clinical record.

#### Category 2 — Employer (Nominated Contact Person)

- **Purpose:** To facilitate return-to-work planning and comply with SIRA requirements for communication between the treating practitioner and the employer. Disclosure is limited to information relevant to functional capacity and workplace duties — not the full clinical record.
- **Consent mechanism:** Tick box to authorise + optional write-in field for the employer contact person's name, role, and contact details (if known).
- **Rationale:** The SIRA Certificate of Capacity consent covers employer disclosure, but Claims Doctor's supplementary consent creates an additional, documented layer of authorisation — specifically naming the individual at the employer who is authorised to receive information. This reduces the risk of inadvertent disclosure to unauthorised personnel within the employer organisation.
- **WorkCover vs CTP distinction:** For WorkCover claims, employer disclosure is expected and typically required. For CTP claims, employer disclosure is optional and only occurs with the patient's explicit consent.

#### Category 3 — Insurer Case Manager

- **Purpose:** To liaise with the insurer's appointed case manager regarding the claim, treatment progress, and return-to-work capacity.
- **Consent mechanism:** Tick box to authorise + optional write-in field for case manager name and contact details (if known).
- **Rationale:** While the SIRA certificate consent covers insurer disclosure generally, Claims Doctor's supplementary consent documents the specific individual at the insurer with whom communication will occur. This is a protective measure — it ensures Claims Doctor can demonstrate that information was shared only with an authorised contact.

#### Category 4 — Support Person (Caregiver, Partner, Family Member)

- **Purpose:** To allow Claims Doctor to communicate with a nominated support person regarding appointment logistics, general progress updates, or clinical information where the patient has expressly authorised this.
- **Consent mechanism:** Tick box to authorise + mandatory write-in field for the support person's name, relationship to the patient, and contact details.
- **Scope limitation:** Disclosure to a support person is limited to the specific information categories the patient authorises. The patient may specify whether the support person is authorised to receive clinical information, administrative information only (e.g., appointment times), or both.
- **Rationale:** Some patients are in acute distress, have language barriers, or rely on a partner or caregiver to navigate the claims process. Explicit, documented consent for this channel protects Claims Doctor from complaints about inadvertent disclosure to family members while enabling patient-centred care.

### 5.3 Standing Consent vs Per-Instance Consent

- **Telehealth consultation consent** is obtained once at intake and applies to all subsequent Claims Doctor consultations unless the patient withdraws consent or the service model changes materially.
- **Third-party disclosure consent** is standing consent that remains in effect for the duration of the patient's engagement with Claims Doctor, unless the patient revokes or amends it in writing.
- **Recording consent and AI tools consent** must be obtained on a per-instance basis. Standing consent is not sufficient for recording or AI tool use.

### 5.4 Consent for Minors and Patients Lacking Capacity

- Patients aged 14–17 may consent to treatment where the practitioner assesses they have sufficient maturity to understand the nature and consequences of the consultation. Where a minor lacks capacity, a parent or legal guardian must consent.
- For patients lacking capacity (e.g., due to injury severity), consent must be obtained from an authorised representative — typically a legal guardian, enduring guardian, or person holding power of attorney.
- The identity and authority of the representative must be documented.

---

## 06 Consent Collection Process

### 6.1 Timing

Consent must be collected **before** the first telehealth consultation. The Supplementary Consent Form (Appendix A) is provided to the patient during the intake process and must be completed and returned prior to the consultation being scheduled.

### 6.2 Method

Consent may be collected via:

- **Digital form** — completed and submitted electronically through the Claims Doctor patient portal or intake system. The system must capture the date, time, and IP address of submission as an audit trail.
- **PDF form** — completed, signed, and returned via email or secure upload. A signed copy must be retained in the patient record.
- **Verbal consent** — accepted only in exceptional circumstances where the patient is unable to complete a written form (e.g., physical injury preventing writing, urgent clinical need). Verbal consent must be documented contemporaneously by the staff member who obtained it, including the date, time, the specific consents given, and the name of the staff member. Written consent must be obtained at the earliest opportunity thereafter.

### 6.3 Storage

All consent records — whether digital, scanned, or documented verbal consent — must be stored in the patient's clinical record within the Claims Doctor practice management system (Halaxy). Consent records must be retained for the minimum period required by section 25 of the HRIP Act: 7 years from the date of the last consultation for adults, or until the patient turns 25 if the patient was under 18 at the date of the last consultation.

### 6.4 Revocation and Amendment

- A patient may revoke or amend their consent at any time by notifying Claims Doctor in writing (email is sufficient).
- Upon receiving a revocation, Claims Doctor must cease disclosure to the relevant party immediately.
- Revocation of telehealth consent means no further consultations will be scheduled. Revocation of a specific third-party disclosure does not affect the patient's entitlement to continue receiving Claims Doctor services.
- All revocations must be documented in the patient record with the date received and the date actioned.

---

## 07 Practitioner Obligations

### 7.1 Before the Consultation

- Verify that the patient's Supplementary Consent Form is complete and on file.
- Confirm the patient's identity at the commencement of the video call.
- Confirm with the patient that they are in a private, suitable location.
- If consent for any element is missing, do not proceed with the consultation until consent is obtained.

### 7.2 During the Consultation

- If the clinical situation requires disclosure to a party not covered by the existing consent (e.g., an emergency referral to a hospital), the practitioner must seek consent in real time and document it.
- If the practitioner determines that the telehealth format is clinically inadequate, they must advise the patient and document the recommendation for in-person assessment.
- If any AI tool or recording is to be used, confirm consent before activating.

### 7.3 After the Consultation

- Document in the clinical record that consent was verified at the start of the consultation.
- Where information is disclosed to a third party, record the date, the recipient, the information disclosed, and the consent relied upon.
- Where the patient requests a copy of information disclosed, provide it within a reasonable timeframe.

---

## 08 Breach and Non-Compliance

### 8.1 Disclosure Without Consent

Any disclosure of patient health information without valid consent — unless an exemption under the HRIP Act or Privacy Act applies (e.g., serious and imminent threat to life) — is a breach of this policy and may constitute a breach of privacy legislation.

Staff who become aware of an unauthorised disclosure must:

1. Cease the disclosure immediately.
2. Notify the Claims Doctor Clinical Governance Lead (or equivalent) within 24 hours.
3. Document the incident in the Claims Doctor incident register per CD-GOV-005.

The Clinical Governance Lead will assess the breach and determine whether notification is required to:

- The affected patient.
- The Information and Privacy Commission (NSW) — for breaches of the HRIP Act.
- The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) — for eligible data breaches under the Notifiable Data Breaches (NDB) scheme (Part IIIC, Privacy Act 1988). An eligible data breach exists where unauthorised access to, or disclosure of, personal information is likely to result in serious harm to any individual to whom the information relates.
- AHPRA — where the breach involves conduct that may constitute a notifiable conduct matter under the Health Practitioner Regulation National Law.

### 8.2 Failure to Obtain Consent

A consultation conducted without a completed Supplementary Consent Form is a non-conformance. The practitioner must:

1. Obtain retrospective consent at the earliest opportunity.
2. If the patient declines to provide retrospective consent, escalate to the Clinical Governance Lead for a risk assessment.
3. Document the non-conformance in the incident register.
