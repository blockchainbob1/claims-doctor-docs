# Informed Consent Template

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This document is the single patient-facing consent form for all Claims Doctor consultations. It captures informed consent for the clinical service, consent for telehealth delivery, and authorisation for third-party information sharing — in one form, collected once at intake.

This form replaces Appendix A of CD-LEG-008 (Telehealth Consent Policy). The policy framework, regulatory basis, practitioner obligations, breach procedures, and consent administration processes remain governed by CD-LEG-008. This document is the artefact that implements that policy.

---

## 02 Scope

**Applies to:**

- Every patient receiving a Claims Doctor consultation, whether for WorkCover (Certificate of Capacity) or CTP (Certificate of Fitness) purposes.
- All consultation modalities (video telehealth, telephone where video is unavailable).

**Does not apply to:**

- Internal Claims Doctor staff communications.
- Face-to-face consultations (if introduced in future, this form will be updated to cover that modality).

---

## 03 Administration Notes (Internal Use Only)

### 3.1 When to Collect

This form must be completed and returned **before** the first consultation is scheduled. It is provided to the patient during the intake process.

### 3.2 Collection Methods

- **Digital form** — completed and submitted electronically through the Claims Doctor intake system. The system must capture date, time, and IP address of submission.
- **PDF form** — completed, signed, and returned via email or secure upload.
- **Verbal consent** — accepted only in exceptional circumstances (e.g., physical injury preventing writing, urgent clinical need). Must be documented contemporaneously per CD-LEG-008 §6.2. Written consent must be obtained at the earliest opportunity thereafter.

### 3.3 Storage & Retention

All consent records must be stored in the patient's clinical record within the Claims Doctor practice management system. Retain for the minimum period required by the HRIP Act and applicable records retention legislation — currently a minimum of 7 years from the date of the last consultation, or until the patient turns 25 if the patient is a minor.

### 3.4 Revocation

A patient may revoke or amend any consent at any time by notifying Claims Doctor in writing. Revocation procedures are governed by CD-LEG-008 §6.4.

### 3.5 Consent for Minors and Patients Lacking Capacity

Governed by CD-LEG-008 §5.4. Patients aged 14–17 may consent where the practitioner assesses sufficient maturity. For patients lacking capacity, consent must be obtained from an authorised representative whose identity and authority are documented.

### 3.6 Standing Consent vs Per-Instance Consent

- **Service consent and telehealth consent** (Part 1 below) — standing consent. Obtained once at intake, applies to all subsequent Claims Doctor consultations unless revoked or the service model changes materially.
- **Third-party disclosure consent** (Part 2 below) — standing consent for the duration of the patient's engagement with Claims Doctor, unless revoked or amended in writing.
- **Recording consent and AI tools consent** — per-instance. Must be obtained fresh at each consultation. Not captured on this form. Governed by CD-LEG-008 §5.3.

### PART 1 — CONSENT TO SERVICE AND TELEHEALTH CONSULTATION

Please read the following carefully. By signing this form, you confirm that you understand and agree to each point.

**About the Service**

1. Claims Doctor provides **medical assessment and certification** for WorkCover and CTP injury claims. The purpose of your consultation is to assess your functional capacity and, where appropriate, issue a SIRA Certificate of Capacity (WorkCover) or Certificate of Fitness (CTP).

2. Claims Doctor **does not provide ongoing primary care**, prescribe medications, or manage conditions outside the scope of your claim. If additional care is needed, your doctor will advise you to follow up with your regular GP or an appropriate specialist.

3. Your consultation is an **independent clinical assessment**. The doctor will exercise their own professional judgement. A certificate may or may not be issued depending on the clinical findings.

**About the Consultation Format**

4. Your consultation will be conducted by **real-time video call** (or telephone if video is unavailable). This is not a face-to-face consultation.

5. Telehealth has **limitations**. Physical examination is not possible. If the doctor determines that an in-person examination is required for safe clinical decision-making, you will be advised to attend a face-to-face appointment with an appropriate provider. A certificate may not be issued in these circumstances.

6. You will present **valid photo identification** (driver's licence or passport) at the start of the consultation. Your identity will be verified against your claim details.

7. You will ensure you are in a **private, quiet location** with a stable internet connection and a device with a working camera and microphone.

8. The consultation will be conducted on a **secure platform** that complies with Australian privacy legislation. The consultation will **not be recorded** unless you provide separate consent at the time. You may also be asked to consent to the use of AI-assisted tools (e.g., transcription) during the consultation — you may decline without affecting your access to the service.

**Risks**

9. As with any medical assessment, there is a risk that the consultation may not fully identify all aspects of your condition. Telehealth reduces the doctor's ability to detect certain clinical signs that would be apparent in a physical examination. If you have concerns about any aspect of your assessment, you have the right to raise them during the consultation or to seek a second opinion from another provider.

**Fees**

10. You have been informed of any applicable **fees** for this consultation, including whether the consultation is fully funded under your WorkCover or CTP scheme or whether any out-of-pocket costs apply.

**Your Rights**

11. You may **withdraw your consent and end the consultation at any time**. This will not affect your right to seek assessment or certification from another provider.

12. You have the right to **ask questions** about any aspect of the service before, during, or after the consultation.

13. You have the right to **seek a second opinion** from another medical practitioner at any time.

14. If you are not satisfied with any aspect of the service, you may lodge a complaint with Claims Doctor at **complaints@claimsdoctor.com.au** or contact the **Health Care Complaints Commission (HCCC)** on 1800 043 159 or at hccc.nsw.gov.au.

☐ **I have read and understood Part 1. I consent to receiving my consultation via telehealth as described above.**

### PART 2 — CONSENT TO SHARE MY HEALTH INFORMATION

Claims Doctor may need to share information about your injury, functional capacity, and treatment with people involved in your claim. The SIRA Certificate of Capacity / Certificate of Fitness contains its own consent section for information sharing with your employer, insurer, other treating practitioners, workplace rehabilitation providers, and SIRA.

**This section provides additional, specific consent for Claims Doctor to share your information with the following nominated contacts.** You should understand that:

- You can choose which categories to authorise. You are not required to consent to all categories.
- Information shared will be limited to what is relevant to your claim and recovery.
- You can revoke or change any of these consents at any time by notifying Claims Doctor in writing at consent@claimsdoctor.com.au.
