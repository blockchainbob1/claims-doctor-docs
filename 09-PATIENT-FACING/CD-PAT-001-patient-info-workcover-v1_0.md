# Patient Information Sheet — WorkCover

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This document tells you everything you need to know before, during, and after your WorkCover consultation with Claims Doctor. It explains what a Certificate of Capacity is, what you need to have ready, what happens during your video appointment, and what to do once you receive your certificate.

---

## 02 Scope

This information sheet applies to injured workers in New South Wales who are accessing Claims Doctor for a WorkCover (workers compensation) consultation via telehealth. It covers initial consultations and ongoing certificate reviews.

This document does not cover CTP (motor vehicle accident) claims. If you were injured in a motor vehicle accident, please refer to the Claims Doctor Patient Information Sheet — CTP (CD-PAT-002).

---

## 03 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Certificate of Capacity | The official SIRA document your doctor completes to record your injury diagnosis, your capacity for work, and the treatment you need. It is the only certificate accepted by insurers for WorkCover claims in NSW. |
| Nominated Treating Doctor (NTD) | The doctor you choose to manage your WorkCover injury. You have the right to choose your own NTD. |
| SIRA | State Insurance Regulatory Authority — the NSW government body that regulates the workers compensation system. |
| Insurer / Scheme Agent | The organisation managing your employer's workers compensation policy and your claim. |
| Suitable Duties | Modified or alternative work tasks your employer can offer that are within your assessed capacity while you recover. |

---

## 04 What Is a Certificate of Capacity?

A Certificate of Capacity is the mandatory legal document used in the NSW workers compensation system. It is not the same as a standard medical certificate or sick note — insurers will not accept those for WorkCover claims.

Your doctor uses the Certificate of Capacity to communicate three things to your employer and insurer:

1. **Your diagnosis** — a clear description of your work-related injury or illness.
2. **Your capacity for work** — whether you can work full duties, modified duties, or have no current capacity. If you have some capacity, your doctor specifies what you can and cannot do (for example, "can lift up to 5 kg" or "can work 4 hours per day").
3. **Your treatment plan** — what treatment you need and any referrals to specialists, physiotherapy, psychology, or other allied health services.

The certificate is what triggers your weekly compensation payments and enables your employer to offer you suitable duties. Without a current, valid certificate, your payments and return-to-work support may be interrupted.

Certificates are generally valid for up to 28 days. You will need to see your doctor for a review before your current certificate expires.

## 05 Before Your Appointment

### What You Need to Have Ready

Before your video consultation, please gather the following:

- **Your WorkCover claim number.** Your employer or their insurer will have given you this when your claim was lodged. If you do not have a claim number yet, contact your employer to confirm they have lodged the claim.
- **Your insurer (scheme agent) name.** This is the company managing your claim — for example, Allianz, GIO, or EML.
- **Your employer's name and address.**
- **A description of your injury.** What happened, when it happened, and what body parts are affected.
- **A list of your current symptoms.** What hurts, what activities are difficult, and anything that has changed since your last appointment.
- **Any recent medical records, imaging results, or specialist reports** related to your injury (if you have them — not mandatory for an initial visit).
- **A device with a camera and microphone.** A smartphone, tablet, or computer with a working webcam. You will need a stable internet connection.
- **A quiet, private space** for the duration of your consultation (15–30 minutes).

### If This Is Your First WorkCover Certificate

If you have been recently injured at work and have not yet received a Certificate of Capacity, you should:

1. Report your injury to your employer as soon as possible.
2. Ensure your employer has lodged (or will lodge) a workers compensation claim.
3. Obtain your claim number.
4. Book your consultation with Claims Doctor.

If your employer has not yet lodged a claim, we can still see you and issue your first certificate. You will need to provide your employer's details so the certificate can be sent to them and the insurer.

## 07 What Happens During Your Consultation

Your consultation is conducted via secure video call and typically takes 15 to 30 minutes. Here is what to expect:

1. **You connect to the video call** at your scheduled time using the link provided when you booked.
2. **Your doctor asks about your injury** — how it happened, your symptoms, what makes them better or worse, and how the injury affects your daily activities and work.
3. **Your doctor assesses your functional capacity** — based on your history and clinical assessment, your doctor determines what work activities you can safely perform during your recovery.
4. **Your doctor discusses your return-to-work plan** — including any restrictions, recommended hours, and what types of duties you can perform.
5. **Your doctor completes your Certificate of Capacity** during the call — it is not sent days later. You are part of the conversation about what goes on the certificate.
6. **Referrals are arranged if needed** — your doctor can refer you to specialists, physiotherapy, psychology, imaging, or other services as part of your claim.

---

## 08 After Your Consultation

### Your Certificate

Your completed Certificate of Capacity is sent digitally immediately after your consultation to:

- **You** (via email).
- **Your employer.**
- **Your insurer.**

You should confirm that your employer has received the certificate. Under the workers compensation system, you are required to provide your certificate to your employer.

### Your Obligations

- **Keep your certificate current.** Certificates are generally valid for up to 28 days. Book your next review appointment before your current certificate expires to avoid any gap in your payments or support.
- **Attend your treatment.** Follow through with any referrals or treatment your doctor recommends. Failure to attend treatment can affect your claim.
- **Communicate with your employer.** Work with your employer on suitable duties in line with your certificate. Your employer is required to provide suitable work if you have capacity.
- **Notify your doctor of changes.** If your condition improves or worsens between appointments, contact us to discuss whether an earlier review is needed.

### Follow-Up Certificates

For ongoing injuries, you will need regular certificate reviews. Claims Doctor can provide these via telehealth on the same basis — same-day appointment, certificate issued during the call, $0 cost with a valid claim.

After the first certificate (which must be issued by a medical practitioner), subsequent certificates may in some cases be issued by a SIRA-approved physiotherapist or psychologist for injuries within their scope of practice. Your doctor will advise you if this is appropriate for your situation.

---

## 09 Cost

There is **no cost to you** for your consultation if you have a valid WorkCover claim number. Claims Doctor bills your insurer directly at SIRA-gazetted rates. You do not need to pay anything upfront, and there are no gap payments.

If you do not yet have a claim number (for example, your claim has just been lodged), contact us to discuss your options.

---

## 10 Your Rights

- **You choose your own doctor.** Under the NSW workers compensation system, you have the right to choose your own Nominated Treating Doctor. You can nominate a Claims Doctor practitioner as your NTD.
- **You can change your doctor at any time.** If you are currently seeing another doctor for your WorkCover injury, you are free to transfer your care to Claims Doctor.
- **Your certificate cannot be backdated.** SIRA guidelines prevent doctors from certifying a period of incapacity for a date before the consultation, except in limited special circumstances. This is why it is important to book your appointment promptly and keep your certificates current.
- **Your medical information is confidential.** Your records are handled in accordance with the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and NSW Health Records and Information Privacy Act 2002. Information is shared with your employer and insurer only to the extent required under the workers compensation legislation. Your doctor can redact any information in clinical notes that is unrelated to your WorkCover claim.

---

- Your current certificate is about to expire and you need a review.

- You need a referral to a specialist or allied health provider.
