# Patient Information Sheet — CTP

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This document tells CTP patients everything they need to know before, during, and after their Claims Doctor consultation. It covers what the service is, who it's for, what to bring, what happens on the call, and what to do with the certificate once it's issued.

---

## 02 Scope

This document applies to anyone seeking a Certificate of Fitness following a motor vehicle accident in NSW. It does not cover WorkCover claims (see CD-PAT-001), independent medical examinations, treatment referrals, or legal advice.

---

## 03 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Certificate of Fitness | The SIRA-mandated document that records your injuries, fitness for work, and treatment needs following a motor vehicle accident. Full name: Certificate of Fitness for Work. |
| CTP | Compulsory Third Party insurance. Every registered vehicle in NSW has a CTP policy (Green Slip). If you're injured in a motor crash, the CTP scheme covers your medical expenses and may cover income loss. |
| SIRA | State Insurance Regulatory Authority. The NSW government body that regulates the CTP and WorkCover schemes. |
| Statutory benefits | Payments you're entitled to under the Motor Accident Injuries Act 2017, including treatment costs and weekly income support. |
| At-fault / not-at-fault | Whether you were mostly responsible for the crash. This affects your entitlements after the first 6 months. |
| Minor injury | Defined under the Act. Includes soft tissue injuries and minor psychological injuries. This classification affects your long-term entitlements. |

## 04 What Is Claims Doctor?

Claims Doctor is a telehealth-first medical clinic. We provide same-day video consultations with doctors experienced in the NSW CTP scheme. During the consultation, the doctor assesses your injuries and issues a Certificate of Fitness — the document your CTP insurer requires to process your claim.

We are not a claims management service, a legal firm, or a rehabilitation provider. We provide medical assessments and documentation. We do not give legal advice, manage your claim, or promise compensation outcomes.

---

## 05 Who Is This Service For?

You can use Claims Doctor if you:

- Were injured in a motor vehicle accident in NSW (as a driver, passenger, pedestrian, cyclist, or motorcyclist).
- Need a Certificate of Fitness to lodge or progress a CTP claim.
- Need a subsequent Certificate of Fitness because your current certificate is expiring.
- Were injured in a work-related motor accident and need a Certificate of Fitness for the CTP component (you will also need a separate WorkCover claim — see CD-PAT-001).

You do not need to know who was at fault. You do not need to have already lodged a CTP claim. You can see us for your first certificate or any subsequent certificate.

---

## 06 What Does It Cost?

$0 out-of-pocket cost with a valid CTP claim. We bill the CTP insurer directly under the SIRA fee schedule. You do not pay anything at the time of the consultation or after.

If you have not yet lodged a CTP claim, we can still see you. However, if your claim is not accepted by the insurer, you may become personally liable for the consultation fee. We will confirm this with you before the appointment proceeds.

**Important:** We never describe our service as "free." The insurer pays for the consultation under the CTP scheme. There is no out-of-pocket cost to you when you have a valid claim.

---

## 07 What You Need Before Your Consultation

Have the following ready before your appointment:

**Essential:**
- Your CTP claim number (if you have one — it is not required to book, but speeds up the process).
- Photo ID (driver's licence, passport, or Medicare card).
- A device with a camera and microphone (smartphone, tablet, or laptop) and a stable internet connection.

**Helpful but not mandatory:**
- The name of your CTP insurer. If you don't know, you can find it using SIRA's CTP "Connect with the Insurer" tool at sira.nsw.gov.au or by calling CTP Assist on 1300 656 919.
- The date and location of the motor accident.
- Details of the vehicle(s) involved (registration, make/model).
- Any police report or event number.
- Your most recent Certificate of Fitness (if this is a follow-up, not your first certificate).
- A list of your current medications.
- Names of any other treating practitioners (GP, physiotherapist, psychologist, surgeon).
- Details of your employer and your job duties (if you were working at the time of the accident).
- Any imaging reports, hospital discharge summaries, or specialist letters related to your injuries.

The more information you bring, the more accurate your certificate will be. But if you don't have everything, you can still attend — the doctor will work with what's available.

## 09 What Happens During the Consultation

The consultation is a structured medical assessment conducted by video. It typically takes 15–30 minutes. Here is what the doctor will cover:

**Injury assessment.** The doctor will ask about the accident, your injuries, your symptoms, and how they affect your daily activities and work. Be specific — the more detail you provide, the more accurately the certificate reflects your situation.

**Functional capacity.** The doctor will assess what you can and cannot do. The Certificate of Fitness focuses on what you are able to do, not just what you can't. This is a SIRA requirement — the certificate is designed to support your recovery by identifying safe activities.

**Work capacity.** If you were working at the time of the accident, the doctor will assess whether you can return to your pre-accident duties, return with modifications, or are unfit for work. If you were not working, the doctor will still assess your capacity for activities of daily living.

**Treatment needs.** The doctor will document any treatment you're receiving or should be receiving — physiotherapy, psychology, medication, specialist referrals. This information goes on the certificate and helps your insurer approve treatment costs.

**Certificate issuance.** The doctor issues the Certificate of Fitness during the consultation or immediately after. You do not need a second appointment.

---

## 10 What Is a Certificate of Fitness?

A Certificate of Fitness is the official SIRA document that records:

- The nature and extent of your injuries from the motor accident.
- Your current fitness for work (fit, unfit, or fit with restrictions).
- Your capacity for activities of daily living.
- Treatment you're receiving or that is recommended.
- Referrals to other health providers or rehabilitation services.

Your CTP insurer uses this certificate to make decisions about your claim — including approving treatment costs, calculating weekly income payments, and planning your recovery.

The certificate is not a diagnosis. It is a functional assessment. It tells the insurer what you can do right now, what support you need, and what the expected recovery trajectory looks like.

---

## 11 What Happens After the Consultation

**You will receive your Certificate of Fitness** via the method confirmed during your consultation (email or via the clinical platform). Check it for accuracy. If anything looks wrong, contact us immediately.

**Provide the certificate to your CTP insurer.** If you have already lodged a claim, send the certificate to your insurer as soon as possible. Include it with any other documents they have requested (medical receipts, proof of earnings).

**If you have not yet lodged a CTP claim,** you should do so promptly. You can lodge via:
- **Online:** Through your MyServiceNSW Account (add the "Motor accident injury claims" service).
- **By form:** Complete the Application for Personal Injury Benefits form from sira.nsw.gov.au and send it to the at-fault vehicle's insurer by email or registered post.
- **By phone:** Some insurers accept initial notifications by phone.

**The 28-day rule:** To receive statutory benefits backdated to the day after the accident, you must lodge your claim within 28 days of the accident. After 28 days, the insurer can still accept the claim (up to 3 months without needing a reason for the delay), but back-payment is not guaranteed. After 3 months, you will need to provide a satisfactory explanation for the delay.

**If you don't know the at-fault insurer,** call SIRA's CTP Assist on **1300 656 919** or use the online CTP "Connect with the Insurer" tool.

---

## 12 Important Rules You Should Know

**Certificates cannot be backdated.** The doctor can only certify your condition as assessed on the day of the consultation. If you needed a certificate last week, we cannot issue one dated last week.

**First certificate validity.** Your first Certificate of Fitness covers a maximum of 14 days. This is a SIRA requirement, not a Claims Doctor policy.

**Subsequent certificates.** Follow-up certificates can cover up to 28 days. You will need ongoing certificates for as long as your injury affects your work capacity or daily activities.

**Telehealth requirements.** The consultation must be conducted via live video. Phone-only or SMS-based consultations do not meet SIRA requirements for certificate issuance. You must have your camera on for the duration of the assessment.

**CTP entitlements depend on fault and injury severity.** All people injured in a motor accident in NSW are entitled to statutory benefits (treatment costs, income support) for up to 26 weeks, regardless of fault. After 26 weeks, ongoing entitlements depend on whether you were mostly at fault and whether your injury is classified as minor or non-minor. The doctor does not determine fault — that is the insurer's decision. We can only document your medical condition.

**We do not provide legal advice.** If you have questions about fault, lump sum compensation, or disputing an insurer's decision, contact CTP Assist on 1300 656 919 or seek independent legal advice. SIRA also provides a free CTP Legal Advisory Service for eligible matters.

## 13 Telehealth Suitability

Video consultations are appropriate for most CTP certificate assessments. However, there are situations where the doctor may determine that a physical examination is required — for example, if the injury involves a condition that cannot be adequately assessed via video (certain orthopaedic injuries, neurological assessments requiring hands-on examination).

If the doctor determines that a telehealth assessment is not sufficient for your situation, they will tell you during the consultation and advise you to attend an in-person appointment with an appropriate practitioner. You will not be charged for a consultation that cannot be completed.

---

## 14 Your Rights

You have the right to:

- Be treated with respect and dignity throughout the consultation.
- Receive a clear explanation of the assessment process before it begins.
- Ask questions about your certificate, your injuries, or the CTP process.
- Request a copy of your certificate at any time.
- Decline to answer any question, understanding that this may limit the information available for your certificate.
- Provide feedback or raise a complaint about the service.
