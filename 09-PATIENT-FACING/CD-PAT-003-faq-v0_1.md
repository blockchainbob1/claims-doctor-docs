## 04 General — About Claims Doctor

### Q: What is Claims Doctor?

Claims Doctor is a telehealth-first medical clinic that provides same-day video consultations for injured workers (WorkCover) and motor vehicle accident victims (CTP) in NSW. Our doctors assess your injury and issue your Certificate of Capacity or Certificate of Fitness during the consultation. We are not a claims management service, legal firm, or insurance broker. We provide medical assessments and documentation.

### Q: Is Claims Doctor a real medical clinic?

Yes. Claims Doctor is operated by Health Data Research Pty Ltd (ABN 39 674 905 376), a registered healthcare provider. Our doctors are fully registered with AHPRA (the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency) and experienced in SIRA-compliant injury assessments. Our registered address is Level 1/457-459 Elizabeth Street, Surry Hills NSW 2010.

### Q: Who are the doctors at Claims Doctor?

Claims Doctor's Medical Director is Dr Robert Laidlaw (MBBS, James Cook University). Dr Laidlaw's career spans emergency medicine, neurosurgery, and sports medicine. He has served on the National Expert Reference Panel for the Australian Department of Health and as an expert advisor to the World Health Organization. All Claims Doctor practitioners are AHPRA-registered medical practitioners with experience in injury assessment and medico-legal documentation.

### Q: Is Claims Doctor only for people in NSW?

Currently, yes. Our service covers WorkCover (NSW workers compensation) and CTP (NSW Compulsory Third Party) claims, both of which are regulated by SIRA and specific to New South Wales. If you were injured in NSW and have an active NSW WorkCover or CTP claim, we can see you regardless of where you are located at the time of the consultation.

---

## 05 Eligibility & Coverage

### Q: Who can use Claims Doctor?

You can use Claims Doctor if you have a workplace injury covered by NSW WorkCover, or a motor vehicle accident injury covered by NSW CTP insurance, and you have a valid claim number (or are in the process of lodging a claim). You must be able to attend a video consultation.

### Q: I haven't lodged my claim yet. Can I still see a doctor?

Yes. If you have been injured at work or in a motor vehicle accident, you can book a consultation. Your doctor can assess your injury and issue the initial certificate. For WorkCover, you or your employer will need to lodge the claim with the insurer. For CTP, you will need to lodge a claim with the relevant CTP insurer. We can guide you on the process during your consultation.

### Q: I already have a GP managing my WorkCover claim. Can I switch to Claims Doctor?

Yes. Under NSW workers compensation law, you have the right to choose your own treating doctor at any time. You can nominate a Claims Doctor practitioner as your Nominated Treating Doctor (NTD). We recommend informing your current GP and your insurer/employer of the change. There is no penalty for switching.

### Q: Can Claims Doctor see me for a non-work injury or general health issue?

No. Claims Doctor is a specialist clinic for WorkCover and CTP claims only. We do not provide general practice consultations. If you need a GP for a non-claims matter, we recommend seeing your regular GP or using a general telehealth service.

### Q: I'm a contractor, not an employee. Am I covered by WorkCover?

It depends on your engagement. Some contractors are deemed workers under the NSW workers compensation system. If your employer or principal contractor has reported the injury and you have been given a claim number, you are eligible. If you are unsure, contact your employer or SIRA directly on 13 10 50.

### Q: My claim has been disputed by the insurer. Can I still see a doctor?

Yes. A disputed or declined claim does not prevent you from receiving medical treatment. However, if the claim is ultimately not accepted, the insurer may not cover the consultation cost. We will advise you of any potential cost implications before proceeding.

---

## 06 Cost & Billing

### Q: How much does a consultation cost?

$0 out-of-pocket with a valid WorkCover or CTP claim number. We bill your insurer directly. You are not required to pay anything upfront or provide credit card details.

### Q: How do you bill the insurer?

For WorkCover consultations, we bill the insurer at SIRA-gazetted rates — the fee schedule mandated by the NSW government. For CTP consultations, we bill at AMA (Australian Medical Association) rates. Both are standard billing arrangements that insurers are required to pay.

### Q: Will I ever be asked to pay out of pocket?

In normal circumstances, no. If your claim number is valid and accepted by the insurer, there is no cost to you. In rare situations — such as a claim that has been formally declined, or a consultation that falls outside the scope of your claim — we will inform you of any potential cost before proceeding. We will never surprise you with a bill.

### Q: Is there a gap payment?

No. We bill at the regulated rates and accept the insurer's payment in full. There is no gap.

### Q: Do I need to pay upfront and get reimbursed?

No. We bill the insurer directly. You do not pay and claim back. This is different from some GP clinics that may charge you and require you to seek reimbursement.

## 07 Booking & Appointments

### Q: How do I book an appointment?

You can book online at claimsdoctor.com.au/book, call us on (02) 5503 5311, SMS 0418 171 898, WhatsApp 0418 171 898, or email book@claimsdoctor.com.au.

### Q: How quickly can I get an appointment?

Same day. We offer appointments Monday to Friday, 09:00–21:00, with weekend availability by arrangement. Most patients are seen within hours of booking.

### Q: What do I need to have ready when I book?

For WorkCover: your claim number, insurer name, employer name, date of injury, and a description of your injury and symptoms.

For CTP: your claim number or police event number, CTP insurer name, date of accident, and details of the motor vehicle accident and your injuries.

For both: a device with a camera and microphone (phone, tablet, or computer) and a private, quiet space for the video call.

### Q: Can I book on behalf of someone else?

Yes. An employer, family member, lawyer, or case manager can book on a patient's behalf. The patient must attend the consultation themselves and provide consent.

### Q: What if I need to reschedule or cancel?

Contact us as early as possible by phone, SMS, WhatsApp, or email. Same-day rescheduling is usually available. There is no cancellation fee.

### Q: Do you offer after-hours or weekend appointments?

Our standard hours are Monday to Friday, 09:00–21:00. Weekend appointments are available by arrangement — contact us directly to check availability.

## 08 The Consultation

### Q: What happens during the consultation?

Your doctor will conduct a clinical assessment via secure video call. This includes discussing your injury and symptoms, assessing your physical capacity (including any movements or tests you can safely demonstrate on camera), reviewing your work duties, assessing your capacity for work, and completing your certificate during the call. Consultations typically run 15–30 minutes.

### Q: Is a video consultation as good as an in-person visit?

For the purposes of issuing Certificates of Capacity and Certificates of Fitness, yes. SIRA has formally endorsed telehealth as a valid mode of consultation delivery for both WorkCover and CTP in NSW. Video consultation is the mandated standard for these assessments. Our doctors are experienced in conducting thorough clinical assessments via video.

### Q: What if my doctor needs to physically examine me?

In the majority of injury assessments for certificate purposes, a video consultation is sufficient. If your doctor determines that a physical examination is clinically necessary — for example, for a complex orthopaedic assessment — they will advise you and arrange an appropriate referral. This is rare for routine certificate issuance.

### Q: Can my employer or insurer sit in on the consultation?

No. The consultation is a private medical appointment between you and your doctor. Your employer and insurer are not permitted to attend. Your doctor will document the relevant findings on the certificate, which is shared with your employer and insurer as required by the SIRA framework.

### Q: Will the consultation be recorded?

No. Video consultations are not recorded. Your doctor takes clinical notes during the consultation, which form part of your medical record and are subject to standard medical record-keeping and privacy requirements.

### Q: What if I have language or communication needs?

Let us know when booking. We can arrange interpreter services or accommodate other communication needs to ensure you can participate fully in the consultation.

## 09 Certificates

### Q: What certificate will I receive?

If you have a WorkCover claim, you will receive a Certificate of Capacity — the SIRA-mandated document that records your injury, treatment, and capacity for work. If you have a CTP claim, you will receive a Certificate of Fitness — the SIRA-mandated document for motor vehicle accident injuries.

### Q: When will I receive my certificate?

Your certificate is completed and signed by your doctor during the consultation. It is sent to you digitally immediately after the call. Your doctor also sends the certificate to your employer and insurer as required.

### Q: Will my insurer accept a certificate from Claims Doctor?

Yes. Our certificates are SIRA-compliant and issued by AHPRA-registered medical practitioners. Insurers are required to accept compliant certificates regardless of which doctor issues them. Our doctors understand the SIRA documentation requirements and complete certificates accurately, which means fewer queries and rejections.

### Q: What does the Certificate of Capacity include?

The Certificate of Capacity documents your diagnosis, the treatment provided or recommended, your current capacity for work (fit, unfit, or fit for selected duties), the specific duties you can and cannot perform, the expected duration of your incapacity, and a return-to-work plan. It is the key document that determines your income support and return-to-work pathway.

### Q: How long is a certificate valid for?

The validity period is set by your doctor based on your clinical presentation. Initial certificates are typically issued for a short period (often 1–2 weeks) with a review date. Your doctor will advise when you need a follow-up consultation for a new certificate.

### Q: I need a certificate for a past date. Can Claims Doctor back-date certificates?

No. Certificates can only be issued for the date of the consultation or prospectively. We cannot issue certificates for periods before we have assessed you. If you need documentation covering a past period, discuss this with your doctor during the consultation — there may be clinical notes or other documentation that can support your claim for that period.

### Q: My employer or insurer says there's an issue with my certificate. What do I do?

Contact us immediately. If there is a query about the content or format of a certificate issued by Claims Doctor, we will review it and resolve the issue directly with the relevant party. Certificate accuracy is a core part of our service.

## 10 Technology & Requirements

### Q: What device do I need for the video consultation?

Any device with a camera, microphone, and internet connection — a smartphone, tablet, laptop, or desktop computer. No special software or app download is required.

### Q: What internet speed do I need?

A standard home broadband or 4G/5G mobile connection is sufficient. We recommend a minimum of 1.5 Mbps download and upload speed. If you can stream video (e.g., YouTube, Netflix), your connection is likely adequate.

### Q: What if my video connection drops during the consultation?

Your doctor will attempt to reconnect. If the connection cannot be re-established, we will contact you by phone to complete the consultation or reschedule at the earliest available time at no additional cost.

### Q: Is the video consultation secure?

Yes. We use secure, encrypted video consultation technology that meets Australian healthcare privacy and security requirements. Your consultation is private and is not recorded.

---

## 11 Privacy & Security

### Q: How is my personal information handled?

Claims Doctor complies with the Australian Privacy Principles under the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and all applicable NSW health records legislation. We collect only the information necessary to provide your medical consultation and issue your certificate. Your information is stored securely and is not shared with third parties except as required for your claim (e.g., sending your certificate to your insurer and employer) or as required by law. See our full Privacy Policy at claimsdoctor.com.au/privacy-policy.

### Q: Who can see my medical records?

Your medical records are accessible to your treating doctor and authorised Claims Doctor clinical staff. Your certificate is provided to you, your employer, and your insurer as required under the SIRA framework. Your full clinical notes are not shared with your employer or insurer unless required by law or with your explicit consent.

### Q: Can I request a copy of my medical records?

Yes. You have the right to access your medical records at any time. Contact us by email or phone to request a copy.

---

## 12 Ongoing Care & Follow-Up

### Q: Can Claims Doctor be my regular doctor for my WorkCover claim?

Yes. You can nominate a Claims Doctor practitioner as your Nominated Treating Doctor (NTD). This means we will manage your ongoing certificate reviews, coordinate your return-to-work plan, and arrange referrals as needed — all via telehealth.

### Q: How often do I need follow-up consultations?

Your doctor sets the review date based on your clinical needs. For most injuries, this is every 1–4 weeks initially, extending as your recovery progresses. Your certificate will state when your next review is due.

### Q: Can Claims Doctor refer me to specialists or allied health?

Yes. Your doctor can arrange referrals to specialists (e.g., orthopaedic surgeons, psychiatrists, neurologists), allied health providers (e.g., physiotherapy, psychology, occupational therapy), pathology, and imaging — all as part of your claim. These referrals are covered by your WorkCover or CTP claim in the same way as the consultation.

### Q: What if my condition gets worse?

Contact us to book a review consultation. If you experience a medical emergency, call 000 or go to your nearest emergency department. Claims Doctor is not an emergency service.

### Q: What happens when I'm ready to return to work?

Your doctor will assess your capacity and issue an updated certificate reflecting your fitness for full duties. They can also liaise with your employer on a graduated return-to-work plan if needed. Your certificate will be updated from "unfit" or "fit for selected duties" to "fit for pre-injury duties" when clinically appropriate.

## 13 For Employers & WHS Managers

### Q: Can I refer my employee to Claims Doctor?

Yes. You can book a consultation on behalf of your employee (with their knowledge). The employee must attend and consent to the consultation themselves.

### Q: How does Claims Doctor help reduce lost time?

By providing same-day consultations, your injured worker gets assessed and documented on the day of injury or notification — not days later. This means a clear return-to-work plan from day one, compliant documentation without delays, and reduced time between injury and active claim management.

### Q: Will I receive the certificate?

Yes. The Certificate of Capacity is sent to the worker, the employer, and the insurer as required under the SIRA framework. You will receive it digitally on the same day as the consultation.

### Q: Can Claims Doctor coordinate with our return-to-work coordinator?

Yes. With the worker's consent, your doctor can discuss return-to-work planning, suitable duties, and workplace modifications with your return-to-work coordinator or WHS manager.

---

## 14 For Lawyers & Insurers

### Q: Can I refer my client to Claims Doctor?

Yes. Personal injury lawyers, claims managers, and case managers can refer clients/claimants directly. Book on their behalf or have them contact us. The patient must attend and consent to the consultation.

### Q: Are Claims Doctor certificates accepted in legal proceedings?

Claims Doctor certificates are SIRA-compliant documents issued by AHPRA-registered medical practitioners. They are the same regulated certificates issued by any treating doctor under the SIRA framework and carry the same legal standing.

### Q: Can Claims Doctor provide medical reports beyond the standard certificate?

Discuss your requirements with us. Standard consultations result in a Certificate of Capacity or Certificate of Fitness. Additional reporting or medicolegal assessments may be available depending on the nature of the request.
