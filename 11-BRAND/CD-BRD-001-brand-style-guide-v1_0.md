# Brand & Style Guide

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This document defines the complete brand identity for Claims Doctor — visual, verbal, and regulatory. It is the single source of truth for how Claims Doctor presents itself across all touchpoints, and must be referenced before creating any marketing, patient-facing, or partner-facing material.

---

## 02 Scope

This guide applies to all Claims Doctor team members, contractors, and any third party producing materials on behalf of Claims Doctor. It covers brand positioning, colour palette, typography, logo usage, tone of voice, audience-specific messaging, and regulatory compliance requirements. It does not cover operational procedures, clinical protocols, or technology specifications.

---

## 03 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| Certificate of Capacity | The SIRA-mandated document for WorkCover injury assessment |
| Certificate of Fitness | The SIRA-mandated document for CTP injury assessment |
| SIRA | State Insurance Regulatory Authority (NSW) |
| AHPRA | Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency |
| TGA | Therapeutic Goods Administration |
| CTP | Compulsory Third Party (motor vehicle accident insurance) |
| WorkCover | Workers' compensation insurance scheme |
| Wordmark | The typographic treatment of "Claims Doctor" as a logo element |
| B2C | Business-to-consumer (patient-facing) |
| B2B | Business-to-business (employer, insurer, legal partner-facing) |

---

## 04 Brand Positioning

Claims Doctor is a telehealth-first medical clinic, not a claims management service or legal referral network. Every visual and verbal choice must reinforce: **real doctors, real medicine, delivered fast through technology.**

### We Are

SIRA-approved doctors providing same-day video consultations and issuing Certificates of Capacity (WorkCover) and Certificates of Fitness (CTP) for injured workers and motor vehicle accident victims in NSW.

### We Are Not

A claims consultant, legal firm, insurance broker, or rehab provider. We don't manage claims, give legal advice, or promise compensation outcomes. We provide medical assessments and documentation.

### Category Definition

We are creating a new category: **the dedicated claims telehealth clinic.** Not a GP clinic that also does WorkCover. Not a marketplace that connects you to doctors. The only clinic built from the ground up for this purpose.

---

## 05 Brand Personality

Claims Doctor sits at the intersection of clinical authority and tech-forward efficiency. It should feel like booking a specialist through the best healthcare app you've ever used.

### Speed

Same-day consultations. Certificate issued during the call. No waiting rooms, no callbacks, no "we'll get back to you."

### Trust

SIRA-compliant. Legally bulletproof documentation. Doctors who understand the medico-legal landscape. Insurers accept our certificates without question.

### Simplicity

Zero out-of-pocket cost. Three steps to a consult. No jargon. We handle the complexity so the patient doesn't have to.

### Care

We don't lead with empathy in the brand voice — but it's always there. Our speed IS our empathy. Getting someone their certificate fast IS caring.

---

## 06 Colour Palette

The palette communicates medical authority (navy) and modern efficiency (teal). Navy replaces generic healthcare blue with something more commanding. Teal draws the eye to CTAs and the "Doctor" in our wordmark.

### Primary

| Colour | Hex |
|--------|-----|
| Navy | `#0B2545` |
| Teal | `#00B4D8` |
| Teal Dark | `#0096B7` |
| Teal Light | `#90E0EF` |

### Functional

| Colour | Hex |
|--------|-----|
| Confirm Green | `#2DC653` |
| Alert Amber | `#F7B32B` |
| Urgent Red | `#E63946` |

### Neutrals

| Colour | Hex |
|--------|-----|
| White | `#FFFFFF` |
| Off-White | `#F8F9FA` |
| Grey 400 | `#ADB5BD` |
| Charcoal | `#212529` |

### Colour Rationale

**Why Navy, Not Blue?**
Every healthcare brand defaults to mid-blue (#0077B6 territory). Navy (#0B2545) immediately separates Claims Doctor from the generic healthcare pack. It reads as authoritative, legal-grade, and serious — exactly what insurers and lawyers expect from documentation they'll rely on in proceedings.

**Why Teal as the Accent?**
Teal sits between blue (trust) and green (go/action). It's the perfect "speed + reliability" signal. It's also the colour used for CTAs, meaning every interaction point on the site is visually coded with the brand's core promise: action, now.

---

## 07 Typography

Three fonts. No exceptions. The display font signals modernity and precision. The body font prioritises readability in medical and legal contexts. The monospace font anchors data, labels, and system UI.

### Display — Space Grotesk 700

Used for: Headlines, hero text, H1–H3 headings, the "Claims" portion of the wordmark, stat callouts.

### Body — DM Sans 400/500

Used for: Body copy, paragraphs, navigation, form labels, buttons. 16–18px for web, 14–15px for app UI.

### Mono — IBM Plex Mono 400

Used for: Section labels, claim reference numbers, status badges, metadata, compliance tags.

### Type Scale (Web)

| Element | Font | Weight | Size |
|---------|------|--------|------|
| H1 / Hero | Space Grotesk | 700 | 48–56px |
| H2 / Section | Space Grotesk | 700 | 32–36px |
| H3 / Card | Space Grotesk | 600 | 20–24px |
| Body | DM Sans | 400 | 16–18px |
| Body Bold | DM Sans | 600 | 16–18px |
| Small / Caption | DM Sans | 400 | 14px |
| Label / Badge | IBM Plex Mono | 500 | 11–12px |
| Button | DM Sans | 600 | 15–16px |

---

## 08 Logo System

The logo is a crosshair symbol — a navy rounded square with a white medical cross formed in negative space, a teal precision dot at centre, and teal crosshair lines. The wordmark always splits: "Claims" in navy/white, "Doctor" in teal.

### Logo Concept — The Crosshair

Medical cross inside a rounded square (app icon shape). The cross doubles as a precision crosshair — signals medical care + targeted accuracy. Clean, scalable, works at 16px favicon. The crosshair represents the focused, specialised nature of the service: we do one thing, and we do it precisely.

### Available Layouts

**Horizontal Lockup (Primary)**
Symbol + "Claims Doctor" side by side. Default for website headers, email signatures, partner materials. Minimum width: 120px on screen, 30mm in print.

**Stacked Lockup**
Symbol above "Claims Doctor". Used when horizontal space is limited — social media avatars, app loading screens, presentation title slides.

**Symbol Only**
The crosshair icon alone. For favicons, app icons, watermarks, social profile images. Minimum size: 32px on screen.

**Wordmark Only**
"Claims Doctor" text without symbol. For inline text references, footer credits, contexts where the icon is already visible elsewhere on the page.

### Colour Variants

| Variant | Symbol | Claims | Doctor | Use Case |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|----------|
| Full Colour | Navy | Navy | Teal | Default — light backgrounds |
| All Navy | Navy | Navy | Navy | Formal / single-colour print |
| All Teal | Teal | Teal | Teal | B2C / patient-facing warm |
| All White | White | White | White | Dark backgrounds / photo overlays |
| White + Teal | White | White | Teal | Dark backgrounds, preserves brand colour |
| All Charcoal | #212529 | #212529 | #212529 | Neutral — documents / fax headers |
| Navy + White Text | Navy | White | Teal | Dark backgrounds, full-colour symbol |

### Clear Space & Minimum Sizes

Maintain minimum clear space around the logo equal to the height of the "C" in Claims. Minimum width: 120px on screen (horizontal lockup), 30mm in print. Symbol-only minimum: 32px / 8mm. Never place the logo on busy images without a solid background container.

---

## 09 Taglines & Messaging

The primary tagline must work on every surface — from Google Ads to a referral partner's email signature link.

### Primary Tagline

> **Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.**

Used on the website hero, Google Business Profile, LinkedIn banner, and all partner-facing materials.

### Variant Taglines

| Context | Tagline |
|---------|---------|
| Google Ads / Short Form | Your certificate. Same day. $0 cost. |
| B2B / Employer | Reduce lost time. Same-day injury assessments for your workforce. |
| B2B / Legal Partners | SIRA-compliant certificates. Issued same day. Every time. |
| Patient / Empathy | Injured? Get your medical certificate today — from home. |

## 10 Tone of Voice

The voice is direct, competent, and calm. Think: the best ED doctor you've ever met — doesn't waste words, clearly knows what they're doing, makes you feel like you're in good hands without being patronising.

### DO — Write like this:

- "Book a same-day video consult. Your doctor will issue your Certificate of Capacity during the call."
- "No out-of-pocket cost with a valid claim number. We bill the insurer directly."
- "Our doctors understand the SIRA system. Your certificate will be compliant, accurate, and accepted first time."

### DON'T — Never write like this:

- "We understand how stressful this time must be for you. We're here to support your healing journey every step of the way..."
- "Our holistic, patient-centred approach ensures comprehensive wellbeing outcomes..."
- "Click here to start your wellness journey with our caring team of passionate professionals!"

### Voice Principles

**Direct, Not Blunt**
We get to the point fast. But we never sound cold or transactional. The speed IS the empathy — we know you're in pain, so we don't waste your time.

**Expert, Not Jargon-Heavy**
We use correct terminology (Certificate of Capacity, not "work cert") but always explain it in plain language. We never assume the patient knows the system.

**Confident, Not Salesy**
We state what we do. We don't oversell. No "99.7% success rate" claims, no "best doctors in Sydney" superlatives. Competence speaks quietly.

## 11 Elevator Pitches

Each audience needs a different entry point. The pitches below are designed to be delivered in under 30 seconds or fit in a LinkedIn message.

### B2C — Injured Patient (WorkCover)

Hurt at work? Claims Doctor gets you a same-day video appointment with a doctor who specialises in WorkCover. They'll assess your injury, issue your Certificate of Capacity during the call, and you don't pay a cent — we bill your insurer directly. No waiting rooms. No confusion. Just the certificate you need to protect your income.

### B2C — Injured Patient (CTP / Motor Vehicle)

Been in a car accident? You need a Certificate of Fitness to start your CTP claim — and you need it fast. Claims Doctor connects you with a SIRA-approved doctor via video today. They'll complete your medical assessment and issue your certificate on the spot. No cost to you with a valid CTP claim.

### B2B — Employer / WHS Manager

One of your workers has been injured. Every day without a medical assessment is a day of uncertainty for your business and your employee. Claims Doctor provides same-day video consultations and issues Certificates of Capacity immediately. That means a clear return-to-work plan faster, reduced lost time, and compliant documentation from day one.

### B2B2C — Personal Injury Lawyer

Your client needs medical documentation to progress their claim. Claims Doctor provides same-day telehealth assessments with SIRA-experienced doctors who issue compliant Certificates of Capacity and Certificates of Fitness. We reduce the bottleneck between injury and documentation so your matter moves forward without delay.

### B2B2C — Insurer / Claims Manager

Incomplete or delayed medical certificates slow every claim. Claims Doctor provides same-day video assessments and issues SIRA-compliant certificates during the consultation. Accurate documentation first time means fewer follow-ups, faster claim progression, and better RTW outcomes for your injured workers.

---

## 12 Visual Split Strategy

The core brand stays consistent. What shifts is the visual temperature and content emphasis. Think of it as the same person wearing scrubs vs a suit — recognisably the same, context-appropriate.

| Element | B2C (Patient-Facing) | B2B (Partner/Referrer-Facing) |
|---------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Primary Colour | Teal dominant — warmer, more inviting, action-forward | Navy dominant — more authoritative, institutional, serious |
| Imagery | People at home on phone/laptop, warm lighting, domestic comfort | Clean interface screenshots, certificate samples, data/compliance visuals |
| Headlines | "Get your certificate today — from home" (outcome-first) | "SIRA-compliant certificates. Issued same day." (compliance-first) |
| CTAs | "Book Now" / "See a Doctor Today" | "Partner With Us" / "Refer a Patient" / "Download Info Pack" |
| Proof Points | Patient testimonials, "$0 cost" messaging, simplicity emphasis | SIRA compliance, doctor credentials, turnaround metrics, integration capabilities |
| Page Examples | Homepage, /workcover, /ctp, /book-now | /for-employers, /for-lawyers, /for-insurers, /partner |

## 13 Brand Usage Rules

Non-negotiable rules for maintaining brand integrity across all touchpoints.

### Do

- Always write "Claims Doctor" as two words with capitals
- Always colour "Doctor" in teal in the wordmark
- Use the full tagline on first mention in any document
- Maintain minimum clear space around the logo (equal to the height of the "C" in Claims)
- Use navy or white backgrounds for the logo — never place on busy images
- Refer to certificates by their correct SIRA names (Certificate of Capacity, Certificate of Fitness)
- Use "video consultation" or "telehealth consultation" — never "virtual visit" or "online chat"
- State "$0 cost with a valid claim number" — never "free" without qualification

### Don't

- Never write "ClaimsDoctor" as one word or "claims doctor" in lowercase
- Never use the logo smaller than 120px wide on screen or 30mm in print
- Never rotate, stretch, or add effects (drop shadows, glows) to the logo
- Never promise claim outcomes ("we'll get your claim approved")
- Never use the word "free" without the qualifier about valid claim numbers
- Never use stock photos of stethoscopes on white backgrounds
- Never use "journey", "holistic", "wellness", or "passionate" in copy
- Never place the logo on teal backgrounds — use navy or white only

---

## 14 Regulatory Compliance

These are not optional. Australian healthcare advertising is heavily regulated. Every piece of content must pass these filters before publication.

### AHPRA Advertising Guidelines

No testimonials that could be interpreted as clinical endorsements. No "before and after" style claims. No superlatives ("best doctors", "leading clinic"). No guarantees of clinical outcomes. Patient reviews can reference the service experience (speed, ease of booking) but not clinical outcomes.

### SIRA Compliance in Marketing

Never imply that Claims Doctor will influence claim outcomes. We provide medical assessments and documentation — we don't advocate for claims. Never suggest that telehealth is equivalent to physical examination where SIRA guidelines require in-person assessment. Always note video-first requirement.

### TGA Advertising Code

No therapeutic claims about the telehealth service itself. We don't "treat" via certificate issuance — we assess and document. Any mentions of treatment, recovery plans, or clinical pathways must be factual and not promotional in tone.

### Financial Claims

"$0 cost" must always be qualified: "with a valid WorkCover or CTP claim number." Never use "free" as a standalone claim — ACCC guidelines require transparency on who bears the cost (the insurer).
