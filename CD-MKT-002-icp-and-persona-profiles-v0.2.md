# ICP & Persona Profiles

**Claims Doctor** · Same-day WorkCover & CTP medical certificates.

---

## 01 Purpose

This document defines the five B2B Ideal Customer Profiles (ICPs) for Claims Doctor's referral partner strategy. Every downstream marketing and sales document — the marketing plan, SEO strategy, Google Ads playbook, social media strategy, and B2B sales playbook — depends on these profiles. If you don't know who you're targeting, everything else is guesswork.

This document does NOT cover B2C patient personas (injured workers, CTP claimants). Those are demand-side — they find us or are sent to us. The ICPs below are supply-side — they are the organisations that refer patients to Claims Doctor.

---

## 02 Scope

**Applies to:** All marketing, sales, and partnership activity at Claims Doctor.

**Geographic scope:** New South Wales only. All five ICPs operate within NSW and deal with patients under SIRA-regulated schemes (WorkCover and CTP).

**What this covers:** Firmographic profiles, decision-maker personas, pain points, messaging angles, objection maps, and channel preferences for each ICP.

**What this does NOT cover:** Pricing strategy (see CD-FIN-002), campaign execution (see CD-MKT-005), or brand messaging (see CD-BRD-001).

---

## 03 Definitions

| Term | Definition |
|------|-----------|
| ICP | Ideal Customer Profile — a firmographic description of the type of organisation most likely to become a referral partner |
| Persona | A named, semi-fictional representation of a decision-maker within an ICP |
| Certificate of Capacity | The SIRA-mandated document for WorkCover injury assessment |
| Certificate of Fitness | The SIRA-mandated document for CTP injury assessment |
| SIRA | State Insurance Regulatory Authority — regulator of NSW workers compensation and CTP schemes |
| NTD | Nominated Treating Doctor — the doctor a worker nominates under WorkCover to manage their claim |
| RTW | Return to Work — the rehabilitation and re-employment process mandated by SIRA |
| ILARS | Independent Legal Assistance and Review Service — provides funding for injured workers' legal representation |

---

## 04 Market Context

The NSW workers compensation scheme covers 4.9 million jobs. In the last financial year, 125,474 workers received income replacement and medical support. Total claim costs reached $5.3 billion in 2023–24, up from $4.4 billion the prior year. Premiums are increasing at 8% annually under a three-year statutory cap through 2025–26.

Nationally, there are over 146,700 serious workers compensation claims per year — more than 400 per day. Labourers, community service workers, trades workers, and machinery operators account for over 75% of serious claims despite representing only a third of the workforce.

This is a large, growing, structurally underserved market. The demand for medical certificates is non-discretionary — every active claim requires ongoing medical documentation. The bottleneck is access to doctors willing and able to do this work efficiently.

---

## 05 ICP Overview

| # | ICP | Segment | Why They Refer | Est. NSW Addressable Orgs |
|---|-----|---------|---------------|--------------------------|
| 1 | Work Injury Legal Practitioners | Personal injury law firms | Every client needs a Certificate of Capacity; delays = delayed claim progression | 150–200 firms with active WC caseloads |
| 2 | Rehabilitation Providers | Return-to-work and rehab centres | Patients on long rehab journeys need regular medical reviews and updated certificates | 100–150 SIRA-approved providers |
| 3 | GP Clinics | Bulk billing and super clinics | Offload low-margin, admin-heavy WorkCover/CTP paperwork they don't want to do | 500+ clinics, ~100 high-priority super clinics |
| 4 | Labour Hire Companies | Staffing agencies, especially Western Sydney | High injury rates in construction/warehousing, need fast same-day consults to keep workforce moving | 200+ licensed agencies, ~50 high-volume |
| 5 | Allied Health — Physiotherapy | Standalone physio practices | Treating patients who need certificate renewals but have no GP willing to do WC paperwork | 800+ practices, ~150 with high WC caseloads |

---

## 06 ICP 1 — Work Injury Legal Practitioners

### 06.1 Firmographic Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Organisation type | Personal injury law firm or practice group within a generalist firm |
| Size | 2–50 fee earners; includes sole practitioners through to mid-tier firms |
| Location | Greater Sydney, Newcastle, Wollongong, Central Coast — anywhere with an active Personal Injury Commission presence |
| Revenue model | No-win-no-fee (plaintiff side); ILARS-funded for workers compensation; costs agreements for CTP |
| Regulatory context | Accredited on the IRO Approved Lawyer list; regulated by Law Society of NSW and Legal Services Council |
| Key service lines | Workers compensation, CTP/motor vehicle accident claims, work injury damages, TPD claims |

### 06.2 Persona — "Sarah the Senior Associate"

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Sarah |
| Title | Senior Associate / Solicitor / Legal Case Manager |
| Age | 30–45 |
| Experience | 5–15 years in personal injury |
| Reports to | Partner / Principal |
| Manages | 1–3 paralegals, 40–80 active files |
| Day-to-day | Runs files end-to-end: client intake, medical evidence gathering, insurer negotiation, commission hearings |

### 06.3 Pain Points

**The daily nightmare is bottlenecked medical evidence.** Sarah's clients need Certificates of Capacity to progress their claims — for weekly benefits, for section 78 disputes, for work capacity decisions, for permanent impairment assessments. Every certificate that's delayed is a client calling her office asking why their payment is late.

Specific pain points:

- **GP reluctance.** Many GPs refuse to do WorkCover paperwork or do it poorly — certificates come back incomplete, inconsistent with clinical notes, or not aligned with SIRA requirements. Sarah spends hours chasing GPs to fix certificates.
- **Wait times.** Getting a client into a GP who actually does WorkCover can take 1–2 weeks. In that window, the client's benefits may be suspended or reduced.
- **Irate clients.** The client doesn't understand why their claim is stalled. They call the lawyer. The lawyer can't fix a medical certificate. Frustration compounds.
- **Insurer disputes.** Insurers use certificate inconsistencies as grounds to dispute capacity. A well-written certificate from a doctor who understands SIRA language is a defensive weapon.
- **Tightening margins.** Personal injury law is increasingly competitive. ILARS funding has specific caps. Firms need to run cases efficiently — every hour spent chasing medical evidence is an hour not spent on billable case strategy.
- **Automation pressure.** Legal tech is automating document review, court filing, and client communication. But the human bottleneck — getting a doctor to see a patient and produce a compliant certificate — can't be automated. It can only be made faster.

### 06.4 What Claims Doctor Solves

| Pain Point | Claims Doctor Solution |
|------------|----------------------|
| GP reluctance | SIRA-approved doctors who only do this work — it's our core business, not a side task |
| Wait times | Same-day telehealth consultations — book today, certificate today |
| Certificate quality | Doctors trained on SIRA certificate requirements; consistent, defensible documentation |
| Client frustration | Faster turnaround = fewer complaint calls to the law firm |
| Insurer disputes | Certificates written in SIRA-compliant language reduce dispute surface area |

### 06.5 Messaging Angle

**Lead message:** "Your clients need certificates. We get them done same-day."

**Supporting proof points:** SIRA-approved doctors, telehealth-first (no travel for injured workers), certificates designed to withstand insurer scrutiny, single point of contact for the firm.

**B2B book chapter angle (70% shared / 30% tailored):** Chapter on "The Medical Evidence Bottleneck in Workers Compensation Claims" — how certificate delays cascade into benefit suspensions, dispute escalation, and client attrition.

### 06.6 Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We already have a GP network" | "How many of them can see your client today? We're not replacing your network — we're the fast option when your regulars can't fit them in." |
| "Will insurers challenge a telehealth certificate?" | "SIRA explicitly approves telehealth consultations. Our certificates are written by doctors who do this daily — they know the language insurers look for." |
| "Our clients prefer in-person" | "Most injured workers would rather do a 20-minute video call from home than travel to a clinic with an injury. We offer choice, not replacement." |
| "What's the cost to the firm?" | "Zero. We bill the patient directly through the SIRA fee schedule. The firm refers, we handle everything." |

### 06.7 Channels & Tactics

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Direct outreach | Email to senior associates and practice managers at Doyle's Guide-ranked firms |
| LinkedIn | Connect with solicitors who post about WorkCover; share content on certificate compliance |
| CPD events | Sponsor or present at Law Society of NSW PI continuing education events |
| ILARS network | Engage with ILARS-approved lawyers directly through IRO listings |
| B2B book | Physical + digital asset distributed to firm partners |

## 07 ICP 2 — Rehabilitation Providers

### 07.1 Firmographic Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Organisation type | SIRA-approved workplace rehabilitation provider; may also deliver vocational assessments and return-to-work coordination |
| Size | 5–50 staff; mix of rehab consultants, exercise physiologists, OTs, and admin |
| Location | Metro Sydney and major regional centres (Newcastle, Wollongong, Central Coast) |
| Revenue model | SIRA fee schedule for insurer-funded services; some private/self-insured employer contracts |
| Regulatory context | Must hold SIRA approval as a workplace rehabilitation provider under the NSW Workers Compensation Guidelines |
| Key service lines | Return-to-work programs, functional capacity evaluations, vocational assessments, injury management coordination |

### 07.2 Persona — "Mark the Rehab Consultant"

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Mark |
| Title | Senior Rehabilitation Consultant / Team Leader |
| Age | 35–50 |
| Background | Exercise physiology, occupational therapy, or allied health degree; possibly a CRC (Certified Rehabilitation Counsellor) |
| Reports to | Clinical Director / Business Owner |
| Manages | 20–40 active return-to-work cases |
| Day-to-day | Coordinates between injured workers, employers, insurers, and treating doctors to execute RTW plans |

### 07.3 Pain Points

**The core problem: rehab plans stall because medical certificates don't match the reality of the patient's functional capacity.**

- **Certificate–capacity mismatch.** The GP writes "unfit for all duties" when the patient is clearly capable of modified duties. Or writes "fit for full duties" when the patient can't lift above shoulder height. Mark's RTW plan is only as good as the certificate that supports it.
- **Long rehab journeys.** Patients post-surgery or with chronic pain may be in the system for 6–24 months. Every few weeks they need an updated certificate. If their GP is hard to access, the whole RTW timeline slips.
- **Insurer pressure.** The insurer wants the worker back at work. SIRA wants the worker back at work. The employer wants the worker back. But without a certificate that specifies suitable duties and hours, nobody can move.
- **Doctor disengagement.** Many GPs see the RTW process as administrative burden. They don't engage with the rehab provider, don't read the RTW plan, and issue generic certificates that don't address functional capacity in meaningful detail.
- **Geographic barriers.** The injured worker might live in Penrith but their GP is in Blacktown and their employer is in Parramatta. Travel with an injury is a real barrier. Telehealth removes it.

### 07.4 What Claims Doctor Solves

| Pain Point | Claims Doctor Solution |
|------------|----------------------|
| Certificate–capacity mismatch | Doctors who understand functional capacity language and write certificates that align with RTW plans |
| Access delays | Same-day telehealth — no waiting weeks for a GP appointment |
| Doctor disengagement | Our doctors engage with the rehab provider's RTW plan as standard practice |
| Geographic barriers | Telehealth means the patient can consult from home, no travel required |

### 07.5 Messaging Angle

**Lead message:** "Your RTW plans work better when the certificate actually matches the patient's capacity."

**B2B book chapter angle:** "Why Return-to-Work Plans Fail — and How Medical Evidence Alignment Fixes Them."

### 07.6 Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We need the doctor to understand the workplace" | "We review the RTW plan before the consultation. Our doctors ask about specific duties, not just 'are you fit for work?'" |
| "Insurers prefer the NTD" | "We're not replacing the NTD. We're the option for when the NTD can't see the patient this week and the RTW plan can't wait." |
| "Our clients have complex injuries" | "That's exactly who we're built for. Complex cases need frequent, accurate certificates — not rushed five-minute GP visits." |

### 07.7 Channels & Tactics

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Direct outreach | Email/call to clinical directors at SIRA-approved rehab providers |
| Industry events | Present at ASORC (Australian Society of Rehabilitation Counsellors) state conferences |
| Insurer relationship | Co-present with rehab providers to insurer claims teams on certificate quality |
| B2B book | Chapter tailored to rehab coordinators' specific workflow challenges |

## 08 ICP 3 — GP Clinics

### 08.1 Firmographic Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Organisation type | General practice clinic — focus on larger bulk billing and super clinics |
| Size | 5–20 GPs; high patient throughput (80–120 patients/day across the clinic) |
| Location | Greater Sydney, particularly Western Sydney, South-West Sydney, and outer metro |
| Revenue model | Predominantly bulk billing; some mixed billing. WorkCover/CTP is a small, admin-heavy revenue line |
| Regulatory context | RACGP accreditation; AHPRA registration; SIRA requirements for NTD obligations |
| Key pain point | WorkCover and CTP consultations are disproportionately time-consuming relative to reimbursement |

### 08.2 Persona — "Priya the Practice Manager"

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Priya |
| Title | Practice Manager |
| Age | 35–55 |
| Background | Health administration, nursing background, or long-tenure in practice management |
| Reports to | Clinic Owner / Principal GP |
| Manages | Reception, billing, compliance, doctor scheduling, patient flow |
| Day-to-day | Keeps the clinic running — rosters, billings, complaints, credentialing, accreditation |

### 08.3 Pain Points

**WorkCover and CTP work is a hassle for most GP clinics.** The consultation takes longer, the paperwork is more complex, the billing is different, and the patients are often frustrated and demanding. Most GPs in a busy bulk billing clinic would rather see three standard consults in the time it takes to do one WorkCover certificate.

- **Low margin per hour.** A standard bulk billing consult pays ~$41 for a Level B (6–20 min). A WorkCover consultation pays better per item but takes 30–45 minutes including the certificate. The effective hourly rate often works out lower.
- **Admin burden.** Certificates of Capacity are multi-page forms requiring specific SIRA language. Many GPs haven't been trained on how to complete them properly. Errors cause insurer rejections, which come back to the clinic.
- **Doctor reluctance.** Many GPs simply refuse to take on WorkCover patients. The ones who do often do it grudgingly, leading to poor patient experience and certificate quality.
- **Patient complexity.** WorkCover patients often have psychosocial overlays — they're stressed about money, their job, their injury. Consultations are emotionally draining. In a high-throughput clinic, this disrupts the schedule.
- **SIRA compliance risk.** If a GP is a patient's NTD, they have ongoing obligations under SIRA guidelines. Some clinics want to avoid this liability entirely.

### 08.4 What Claims Doctor Solves

| Pain Point | Claims Doctor Solution |
|------------|----------------------|
| Low margin work | Refer the WorkCover/CTP patient to us — free up the appointment slot for three bulk billing consults |
| Admin burden | We handle all SIRA-specific documentation; the clinic doesn't touch it |
| Doctor reluctance | Give the reluctant doctors an out — "We have a specialist referral pathway for WorkCover" |
| Patient complexity | We have doctors who are specifically trained and willing to handle these consultations |
| NTD obligation | We can become the NTD, removing the obligation from the referring GP |

### 08.5 Messaging Angle

**Lead message:** "Stop losing money on WorkCover consults. Send them to us."

This is the bluntest ICP. The value proposition is economic: Claims Doctor takes a low-margin, high-hassle service off the GP clinic's plate and handles it better.

**B2B book chapter angle:** "The Hidden Cost of WorkCover Consultations in General Practice" — economic analysis of effective hourly rates for WorkCover vs. standard billing, and the opportunity cost of blocked appointment slots.

### 08.6 Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We should keep continuity of care" | "You keep the patient for everything else. We only handle the WorkCover/CTP certificate component. The patient still sees you for their ongoing health needs." |
| "Will our patients go to you for everything?" | "No. We don't do general practice. We only issue SIRA certificates. The patient comes back to you for everything else." |
| "We've never referred out for this" | "Most clinics haven't — because there wasn't a viable option. Now there is. Try it with one patient and see the time you save." |

### 08.7 Channels & Tactics

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Direct outreach | Email/visit to practice managers at Western Sydney super clinics |
| Fax (yes, fax) | Many GP clinics still operate on fax-based referral pathways; a one-page fax flyer works |
| Local area marketing | Attend Western Sydney PHN events and GP networking sessions |
| Google Ads | Target "WorkCover doctor near me" — intercept the patient directly, then backfill the GP relationship |
| B2B book | Distributed to practice managers with a one-page ROI summary |

## 09 ICP 4 — Labour Hire Companies

### 09.1 Firmographic Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Organisation type | Labour hire agency — licensed under the Labour Hire Licensing Act 2018 (NSW) |
| Size | 20–500+ workers on books; 5–30 internal staff |
| Location | Western Sydney (Parramatta, Penrith, Liverpool, Blacktown), with placements across Greater Sydney |
| Revenue model | Margin on hourly labour rates (20–35% markup); volume-driven |
| Industries served | Construction, warehousing, manufacturing, logistics, food processing |
| Regulatory context | Must hold NSW Labour Hire Licence; must carry workers compensation insurance; subject to SafeWork NSW and Fair Work compliance |

### 09.2 Persona — "Dave the Operations Manager"

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Dave |
| Title | Operations Manager / Workforce Coordinator |
| Age | 35–55 |
| Background | Came up through the trades or logistics; may have WHS certification |
| Reports to | Owner / Managing Director |
| Manages | Workforce scheduling, site placements, injury response, insurer liaison |
| Day-to-day | Gets the right workers to the right sites, handles callouts, manages injuries and RTW processes |

### 09.3 Pain Points

**Every day a worker is off-site is a day the agency earns nothing on that placement.** Labour hire companies have a direct financial incentive to get injured workers assessed fast, cleared for suitable duties if appropriate, and back on site as quickly as possible.

- **High injury frequency.** Construction, warehousing, and manufacturing are among the highest-risk industries. Labourers and machinery operators account for 40%+ of all serious claims nationally. Labour hire agencies deal with injuries weekly, not monthly.
- **Workers without a GP.** Many labour hire workers — particularly those on temporary visas or recently relocated — don't have an established GP. When they get injured, there's no NTD to go to. The agency scrambles to find one.
- **Same-day pressure.** The site supervisor wants to know if the worker can come back tomorrow on modified duties. The insurer wants a certificate within 48 hours. The worker is sitting at home waiting. Speed is everything.
- **Premium impact.** Every claim drives the agency's workers compensation premium up. An 8% annual increase is already baked in across NSW. Poor claims management compounds this. Agencies that can demonstrate fast RTW outcomes get better premium treatment.
- **Compliance exposure.** Labour hire agencies are the employer of record. They carry the WHS obligation, the workers comp obligation, and the RTW obligation. A worker without medical documentation is a compliance gap.

### 09.4 What Claims Doctor Solves

| Pain Point | Claims Doctor Solution |
|------------|----------------------|
| Speed | Same-day telehealth — worker gets assessed today, certificate issued today |
| No GP | We become the treating doctor for the claim; no need to find a GP first |
| RTW pressure | Our certificates specify suitable duties and hours clearly, enabling fast modified-duties RTW |
| Premium management | Faster RTW = shorter claim duration = better premium outcomes |
| Compliance | Documented, SIRA-compliant medical assessment from day one |

### 09.5 Messaging Angle

**Lead message:** "Your worker got hurt this morning. We'll have a certificate by this afternoon."

Labour hire is the most time-sensitive ICP. The value proposition is speed and availability, backed by premium impact.

**B2B book chapter angle:** "The Cost of Every Lost Day — How Fast Medical Assessment Protects Your Workers Comp Premium."

### 09.6 Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "We send them to the nearest medical centre" | "And they wait 3 hours in a queue, see a GP who's never done a WorkCover certificate, and the certificate arrives two days later half-completed. We do it in 20 minutes via video." |
| "Our insurer has a preferred provider" | "We work within the SIRA framework. The worker has the right to choose their treating doctor. We're simply another — faster — option." |
| "The workers don't have phones/internet" | "Most workers have smartphones. For those who don't, the consultation can be done from any device with a camera — the site office computer works." |

### 09.7 Channels & Tactics

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Direct outreach | Visit operations managers at Western Sydney labour hire offices |
| Industry associations | Present at RCSA (Recruitment, Consulting & Staffing Association) events |
| Site visits | Offer on-site "WorkCover Info Sessions" for agency staff — positions Claims Doctor as a knowledge partner |
| LinkedIn | Target ops managers and WHS coordinators at agencies |
| B2B book | Hand-delivered to managing directors with a same-day trial offer |

## 10 ICP 5 — Allied Health — Physiotherapy Practices

### 10.1 Firmographic Profile

| Attribute | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Organisation type | Standalone physiotherapy practice (not hospital-based or multi-disciplinary mega-clinics) |
| Size | 2–10 physiotherapists; 1–3 admin/reception |
| Location | Across NSW — metro Sydney, regional centres, suburban strips |
| Revenue model | Mix of private, DVA, NDIS, and workers compensation; WC patients billed under SIRA fee schedule |
| Regulatory context | AHPRA-registered; SIRA-approved as treating allied health practitioners |
| Key service lines | Musculoskeletal physiotherapy, sports physio, post-surgical rehab, workplace injury rehabilitation |

### 10.2 Persona — "Jess the Practice Owner"

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Name | Jess |
| Title | Principal Physiotherapist / Practice Owner |
| Age | 30–50 |
| Background | Physiotherapy degree, possibly a Masters in musculoskeletal or sports physio; started own practice after 5–10 years in a hospital or large clinic |
| Manages | 2–8 staff; handles the business as well as treating patients |
| Day-to-day | Sees 15–25 patients per day; manages staff, billing, marketing; tries to grow the practice |

### 10.3 Pain Points

**Physios treat the injury but can't issue the certificate.** A physiotherapist cannot issue a Certificate of Capacity or Certificate of Fitness — only a medical practitioner (doctor) can. So every WorkCover patient who comes to physio still needs a doctor to sign the paperwork.

- **Patient doesn't have a GP.** The patient comes to physio for their shoulder, but their GP won't do WorkCover certificates. Or they don't have a GP at all. The physio is stuck — they're treating the patient but the claim paperwork is blocked.
- **Certificate doesn't match treatment.** The GP writes "unfit for duties involving repetitive overhead work" but the physio is specifically rehab-ing the patient for exactly that. The certificate and the treatment plan are misaligned, confusing the insurer and the employer.
- **Physio can't influence the certificate.** The physio sees the patient 2–3 times per week and knows their functional capacity better than anyone. But the GP, who sees them once a month for 10 minutes, writes the certificate. The physio has no formal mechanism to input.
- **Patient frustration spills over.** When the claim is delayed because of certificate issues, the patient takes it out on whoever they see most often — which is usually the physio.
- **Referral pathway gap.** The physio wants to refer the patient to a doctor who actually understands WorkCover and will engage with the treatment plan. Most don't know where to send them.

### 10.4 What Claims Doctor Solves

| Pain Point | Claims Doctor Solution |
|------------|----------------------|
| No GP for certificates | We become the treating doctor for certificate purposes — the physio keeps treating |
| Certificate–treatment alignment | Our doctors will review the physio's treatment plan and write certificates that are consistent with it |
| No influence mechanism | The physio can send us clinical notes; we'll incorporate functional capacity information into the certificate |
| Referral pathway | One referral pathway, one phone number, same-day consults — simple for the physio to recommend |

### 10.5 Messaging Angle

**Lead message:** "You treat the injury. We handle the certificate. Same-day."

This is the cleanest complementary relationship. Physios can't do certificates. We only do certificates. There's no competition — it's pure symbiosis.

**B2B book chapter angle:** "The Certificate Gap in Allied Health — Why Your Treatment Plan Fails Without Aligned Medical Documentation."

### 10.6 Objections & Responses

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I just tell my patients to go to their GP" | "And if their GP won't do it, or takes two weeks, your treatment plan stalls. We're the fast, reliable backup." |
| "Will your doctor override my treatment plan?" | "No. Our job is to assess capacity and issue the certificate. We review your clinical notes to align the certificate with your treatment goals." |
| "My patients don't want to see another doctor" | "It's a 20-minute video call. Most patients prefer it to an in-person GP visit with travel and waiting." |

### 10.7 Channels & Tactics

| Channel | Tactic |
|---------|--------|
| Direct outreach | Email/visit to practice owners at standalone physio clinics |
| APA engagement | Attend Australian Physiotherapy Association NSW branch events; advertise in APA communications |
| Local networking | Physio practices cluster in suburban strips — door-to-door introduction with an info pack |
| Cross-referral | Frame it as a mutual referral partnership: we refer patients who need physio to them, they refer certificate needs to us |
| B2B book | Distribute at APA events and through direct mail to practices |

## 11 Cross-ICP Shared Characteristics

Despite targeting five distinct segments, there is roughly 70% overlap in what they care about. This informs the shared core of the B2B book and all content marketing.

### 11.1 Universal Pain Points (Shared Across All ICPs)

1. **Certificate delays harm everyone downstream.** Whether it's the lawyer, the rehab provider, the employer, or the patient — when a medical certificate is late, incomplete, or poorly written, the entire claim process stalls.
2. **GPs don't want to do this work.** This is the structural market failure Claims Doctor exploits. Most GPs find WorkCover/CTP documentation low-margin, high-hassle, and emotionally draining. The supply of willing, capable doctors is shrinking.
3. **Telehealth is an advantage, not a compromise.** For injured workers, travelling to a clinic is often painful, expensive, and unnecessary. A video consultation is faster, cheaper, and more accessible.
4. **SIRA compliance is non-negotiable.** Every certificate must meet SIRA's requirements. A certificate written by a doctor who understands the scheme is worth materially more than one written by a GP who does it reluctantly twice a year.

### 11.2 B2B Book Content Architecture

## 12 ICP Prioritisation

Not all ICPs are equal for launch. Prioritised by: referral volume potential, ease of outreach, speed to first referral, and strategic signalling value.

| Priority | ICP | Rationale |
|----------|-----|-----------|
| 1 | Work Injury Legal Practitioners | Highest volume per relationship. One firm with 50 active files = 50 potential patients. They're concentrated, identifiable (Doyle's Guide, IRO Approved Lawyer list), and commercially motivated. |
| 2 | Labour Hire Companies | Speed is their currency. Easy to demonstrate ROI (premium savings + lost-day reduction). Western Sydney is a geographic cluster we can blanket. |
| 3 | Allied Health — Physiotherapy | Cleanest complementary relationship. No competitive tension. Easy "yes" for the physio — we solve a problem they literally cannot solve themselves. |
| 4 | Rehabilitation Providers | Valuable but slower sales cycle. Need to demonstrate certificate quality before they'll trust us with their insurer relationships. |
| 5 | GP Clinics | Largest addressable market but hardest to convert. Practice managers are gatekeepers. Requires proof of concept from other channels before investing heavily here. |
